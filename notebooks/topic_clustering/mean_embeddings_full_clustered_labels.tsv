the management doesn't involve heads of department and key employees into the process of decision-making and strategy-setting.

the company has good people but puts them under far too much pressure with little thanks.	lot, all, systemize
. after equipping people, please let them get the work done.  . we hire the best people who know what to do and tell them what to do and what not to do.  . we need to say what we mean and mean what we say so as to foster trust.  . we need to listen	lot, all, systemize
respect, show people that they matter and are not just disposable.treat others, regardless of role, how you want to be treated.it takes a village to be successful.act like it and mean it.words are just that, words, actions are key.	lot, all, systemize
i understand everyone is busy but when employees complain about having more fun activities at work. management works hard to fulfill that but when time comes hardly anyone contributes.	lot, all, systemize
other people needs to be more proactive with their people and other people.	lot, all, systemize
amount of work of each individual is not properly organised in my oppinion.  employes who work honest and hard are not employes who are most appriciatedd and well paid. so motivation to be the best and to do your best is not growing. it is faiding.	lot, all, systemize
motivated people always help to get better results for the company , 'share' it's always a key word to make this happen	lot, all, systemize

always choose good team leaders with excellent job knowledge.	lot, all, systemize
the acknowledgement and reward for a job well done	lot, all, systemize
our management here does not seem to want to listen to the employees and use our ideas as to what we think would work best to make this place a better work environment.	lot, all, systemize
keep up the good work	lot, all, systemize
good worker does not make good leader.  management should be able to anticipate problems that may happen before they actually happen.	lot, all, systemize
i don't really get feed back unless something goes wrong. there is really no communications i have to constantly ask question which is fine but when i ask to make sure i get multiple answers from the same people or multiple people.	lot, all, systemize
right people in the right place	lot, all, systemize
we are wasting time to not so important things rather then dealing with the once that are very important.	lot, all, systemize
to divide the job equally.	lot, all, systemize
team leaders are not doing their job properly.	lot, all, systemize
all levels of management/supervisors to be knowable of the systems. when everyone has a question we can go to anyone.  to many meetings, when you need someone they are not there.  open communication to everyone. no secrets of anything.	lot, all, systemize
as far as i am concerned, i am fully satisfied with the company	lot, all, systemize
everything but i would like some empowerment on my duties and specify them  i would like everyone to know who i am and that they really count on me no just assuming i have the power to do things or that i do it because i like to mess with people	lot, all, systemize
senior leadership sometimes i believe that they just say what they think you want to hear rather than finding solutions.	lot, all, systemize
there is no need to improve.100% good	lot, all, systemize
having consideration and good way of appreciation.	lot, all, systemize
the efficiency in the whole station is not good enough. too many desks have too little work to fill in the whole 8-hour workday. hope management can look into this issue and distribute workload fairly, reasonably.	lot, all, systemize
[company] need to understand what we actually do onsite, maybe they could come and work alongside the guys whilst the work is actually being done?	lot, all, systemize
communication from management above my level:management saying and doing the same thing:management saying one thing to one person then contradicting it by saying something completely different to another:i need more room to say everything i want to	lot, all, systemize
i think the managers need to be more open to their subordinates.like for example immersion in work to know how the process and the stand of the employees.to see how they see things.	lot, all, systemize
good to great	lot, all, systemize
i feel with the amount of stretch/shrink wrapping that is done on a daily basis, some equipment for this job duty/function is needed to fulfill the job more efficiently.  we should work smarter, not harder!	lot, all, systemize
just to stay the same and work to be done as well	lot, all, systemize
hope to the company do the best	lot, all, systemize
do not have the idea when cut-off or layoff will get stopped.	lot, all, systemize
communication and agreement between pcm/acc/cssv teams were the key in the past. right now everybody is only worried about their working area because all he pieces have been tore apart.	lot, all, systemize
i think having more meetings or something explaining what the plans are and how we are going to get there would be best.	lot, all, systemize
we hear that the us is making improvements but we still have little clue who is doing what in some of the stations and rarely get timely responses to emails. super frustrating!	lot, all, systemize
the pressure is too high, they expect way too much from us. in our division, we need 1 more person, but nothing has been done to solve this problem. and i think this is a pity.	lot, all, systemize
opportunity to widen our knowledge, job rotation	lot, all, systemize
we need more employees to get the job done.	lot, all, systemize
nothing as such. everything going great.	lot, all, systemize
we need to be more focused on what we do.  we cant do everything and do it well.  we cant be everything to everyone, and performs everyone's tasks. we need to be able to hold the right people accountable for own actions or non-actions	lot, all, systemize
i feel like we could communicate better to get things done quicker and more effectively	lot, all, systemize
i would like to suggest, if every department can support each other to make thing happen.	lot, all, systemize
seems everyone has there own way and no one want to share information that would make the job easier. they leave you on your own.	lot, all, systemize
"communication from management. it appears as though we generally find out things from ""the great vine"" rather than from the source itself."	lot, all, systemize
we need better communication, we always find things out after they have happened. it's important that we know what's going on as well or what will go on so we are aware.	lot, all, systemize
everyone should take pride in there work	lot, all, systemize
its okay to give bad news too	lot, all, systemize
we need more outing trip to everyone can be communicate.	lot, all, systemize
airport office everything going properly and as per me no need anything to improve	lot, all, systemize
the agents can tell when something is going to happen and leadership has a way of wanting everything kept a secret.	lot, all, systemize

nothing specific everyone will work hard for company’s future betterment.	lot, all, systemize
nothing specific everyone should work hard.	lot, all, systemize
everything is good in my eyes	lot, all, systemize
if [company] want to succeed in the way they want to.  they need to look at how things are being done and have some respect for the people and support them to get a top quality job done.  teamwork is a joke here it's each dept for them selfs	lot, all, systemize
time will speak.as now every thing working well	lot, all, systemize
nothing comes to mind	lot, all, systemize
still so difficult to get things done. so many emails	lot, all, systemize
need to have outing in order to get close teamwork	lot, all, systemize
i think we need to make better instructions for situations when somebody is on vacation or on sick leave.	lot, all, systemize
too many priorities at a time.  we need the opportunity to be successful at every task. i personally do not like to 'settle' for less than my best because there is not enough bandwidth.	lot, all, systemize
nothing, we are in right track	lot, all, systemize
all the teams need to understand what each department does. we all have our own ideas what is done without the correct knowledge. it like the picture on the message boards. success and what its really like.	lot, all, systemize
team work as a whole, i over hear things : its not my job, i don't have time, go ask ???? we should all have one goal in mind. get the file done correctly in a timely manner so the customer is happy. in turn this will make the company profitable.	lot, all, systemize
the people must love each other	lot, all, systemize
team work is key to making things happen - if everyone works together then what we offer our customers is 10 times better - still work to be done	lot, all, systemize

i think we could work more in a team, we could better communicate with each other and solve the problems together. it would be useful at least one team meeting per month to communicate and see what works good or worst and how can we improve our work.	lot, all, systemize
from my point of view, everything is working very well.	lot, all, systemize
need to break down the walls created during nfe. we cannot shift work out that is currently been done and yet still keep resources. this is just not sustainable	lot, all, systemize
we are doing great as a team, we need to continue doing better to get the best out of it.	lot, all, systemize
nothing right now	lot, all, systemize
[company] and isc often do not work well as a team.	lot, all, systemize

people's recognition, we must acknowledge people burn-out-effect.	lot, all, systemize
there needs to be better air filtration/circulation in the area that i work. everyone needs to have their own work station. everyone should have their own cubicle at least. helps prevent the spread of sickness beyond the normal workplace illnesses.	lot, all, systemize
maybe more benefits or incentives for the staffs who are working hard, so everybody can be more motivated to work hard.	lot, all, systemize
there's a reason why [company] is losing good talent.some of us wear lots of hats for the purpose of 'saving' money.i don't believe i will be here for the next eos unless something changes. its unfortunate that i'm writing this. good luck and thankyou	lot, all, systemize

im glad we got new equipment but it needs to be maintained forklifts need work. this building also needs work	predefine, systemize, all
nothing is working well here at the crawfordsville terminal  need drivers	predefine, systemize, all
the new equipment	predefine, systemize, all
making pickups.  making service.  paying attention to emails stressing the need to move late or sitting freight.  late linehaul arrivals.	predefine, systemize, all
communication between customer service and production. the c4c tool is too complicated to use and fast interaction impossible.	predefine, systemize, all
supervisors to make sure there are enough load bars for our work.we who dive the interstates need the equipment to be safe as well as legal.	predefine, systemize, all
i would like to see about getting trailers from terminal to terminal sooner to get our freight our on the road for delivery sooner.	predefine, systemize, all
the management should be replaced or removed.	predefine, systemize, all
trailers are old  dock to small	predefine, systemize, all
getting rid of rural deliveries.  getting rid of distribution deliveries where it takes 1-2hrs to deliver and you have to count there freight.  linehaul-drivers not returning to their home terminals to eliminate layover and hotel bills.	predefine, systemize, all
where are we heading and why are we struggling over all.  line haul will never be fixed if we don't stop picking up freight at 8,9,10pm at night.  we are the only carier who does this for regular ltl rates.	predefine, systemize, all
what is the plan for standard forwarding.	predefine, systemize, all
our linehaul is going to have to arrive earlier. we must get out with these peddles earlier. stress is a killer. if you want us to care about deliveries we must leave leave  earlier.	predefine, systemize, all
making sure the right freight is loaded and pro #s are correct with the bills	predefine, systemize, all
we still have way too many trailers with missing and damaged placard holders which is required for hauling hazardous materials. also there are only a select few who actually put an effort into trying to make this company and/or terminal better.	predefine, systemize, all
i think the doc guys need more training on handling equipment they use every day! and for training on loading trailers and moving customers freight so there is less damage going on.	predefine, systemize, all
more learning about the new technology	predefine, systemize, all
the laptops are infinitely slow. the eternal waiting times affect employee motivation and slow down work results, which is certainly more expensive overall than faster laptops.	predefine, systemize, all
technology material needed to do a great work (computer).	predefine, systemize, all
i have new and very good working tools.	predefine, systemize, all
telephonica/bt transission gives many technical problems, right now telephone system is not up to date and gives bad performance and leak of service; new system to replace is not yet available due to delays. old printers in house = daily breakdowns.	predefine, systemize, all
the performance of the it network (computers are very slow) should be adjusted.	predefine, systemize, all
the greatest fault that i see as a driver is the way we document pick ups by calling them in via phone or manually typing them into the people net. the mismanagement and tracking of empty trailers is putting a damper on the efficiency of the company.	predefine, systemize, all
we need skids for blocking and to load boxes on. we need more paid sick days like the office get .the outbound guys need to load better.we need more money	predefine, systemize, all
we as whole agheera we need to be little more process oriented. in regards to the itil processes.	predefine, systemize, all
we need lighter and more flexible processes in terms of hr	predefine, systemize, all
it is very important to keep up with the market changes. it is just fine for now, but as a reminder, we need to keep improving ourselves.	predefine, systemize, all
systems need to be proving efficient for undertaking increased amounts of volume in traffic.we need to have systems in place before brexit and use this as the transition period now.if we can streamline our services and systems now,we will be ready.	predefine, systemize, all
for the south bend terminal we need to fix the arrival times in the morning so we can get the freight delivered and the customers taken care of	predefine, systemize, all
we really need a new inventory management system	predefine, systemize, all
loads safely getting to their destination and drivers incidents.	predefine, systemize, all
faster implementation and change of freight soft	predefine, systemize, all
timely information and handheld scanning equipment to speed up pickups	predefine, systemize, all
get hand held devices/app that we can use with our smart phones that would turn our phones into handhelds. get rid of as many cell phones as you can & offer employees that are willing to use their own cell phones a monthly bonus towards our own bill	predefine, systemize, all
linehaul linehaul linehaul how many times do we need to tell you people?	predefine, systemize, all
deck bars will improve the volume we can haul, lack of load straps to secure freight and minimize damage needed. each trailer should have 4 straps assigned to it. your damage claims are high, no heat on dock in extreme winter bad. teach strap usage.	predefine, systemize, all
we need maybe better hardware (new pc) and internet connection to work faster	predefine, systemize, all
software we use should be easier to use and get reports, maybe we need a training to use it properly.	predefine, systemize, all
cooperation between branches and responsibility for other branch shipment same as for own clients.	predefine, systemize, all
replace the supervisor	predefine, systemize, all
we struggle with software and hardware issues. the new phones we got are not very good & they go out of control. it took a long time before the software on my pc was installed with my new id card. when new people start we always do the setup ourselfs	predefine, systemize, all
it platforms (booking, warehouse and so on)	predefine, systemize, all
the dust in this warehouse is too much	predefine, systemize, all
4d co-operation has improved a lot but we could still benefit more by using our huge network	predefine, systemize, all
we need easier access to mail via mobile phone and also roaming in foreign countries must be a minimum in 2017!!!!	predefine, systemize, all
