the teams are working well and doing their best, but the quality of staff needs improving as some of the guys are not up to the job ie... have medical issues, age and are better suited to a office role as they are from that background.	company
i consider that currently the company does not look after the interests of employees, so i do not find any positive aspects to highlight.	company
upper management needs to embrace safety and lead by example.	company
the doors are open and i have a place to work for now	company
unbalanced work load, bad attitude with employees, and no feed back from mgmt	company

the way shipments are handle since they started a-z.	company
we need timely it system support and printers and system equipment development	company
its composed of good environment/ attitude/ respect/ give and take/ open mindedness.	company
nothing to improve	company
at present everything is a struggle.	company
gaining project business and being the market leader, albeit on very poor margins.	company
contract issues prevent me completing my job, which i have escalated to senior management and received no resolution.	company
look for improvements for the client, not just internal.	company
not all our customer (bps) would have a high labor arbitrage hence our gsc leadership team and [company]f leadership need to think as how gsc can service all bps across our standard catalogue.	company
we must ensure real-time kpis to measure them.	company
it must be global standard.	company
we are often acting based on opinion rather than facts.	company
we have too many and too complicated internal processes.	company
we need to be more simple, streamline and consistent in our planning and execution (from top to down).	company
we need to make decisions based on clear evidence and not emotions or egos.	company
we have a less efficient bid process now that does not serve our customers as well, and it's resulting in more man-hours going into rfq proposals while jobs are cut elsewhere	company
our current operational performance is not where it needs to be.	company
i keep hearing that we have seen significant improvement, but we still have a long way to go.	company
our quote process on rfq, we need quote considering customer quote format rather just looking ipt.	company
invoicing need a lot of improvement.	company
countries need to respect and honor rates they provide	company
invoicing is outsourced to cae and no ownership on local level.	company
the operational response time and c/s response time needs to be improved.	company
more focus needs to be on voice of customer and ability to react quickly to the needs at all touch points in the global organization.	company
we should hear sales team and compile the direct feedback from clients to take action!	company
too often we focus on internal setups between departments instead of focusing on doing the right thing for the overall group and most importantly the customer.	company
business process optimization and how it facilitates core processes	company
there needs to be more innovation in practices and not only except change, when it is forced upon us.	company
a lot of the hold up with shipments from my part are due to waiting on ilvc to get back to me and georgia/ baku giving document approval	company
i would like to see more freight forwarders in the company instead of paint by numbers admin people.	company
it may be the way the industry is going or our clients demands but i see a lack of commercial acumen at times.	company
[company] needs user friendly systems that communicates with each other to save time, increase efficiency and productivity	company
some where we are lacking , due to airlines, we book flight  but they don't fly as booked to not commit quality for service priority shipments	company
i feel that not every department in [company] uk has bought into or are acting like freight forwarders, and that more could be implemented moving forward to develop all members of staff to be freight forwarders in their own right	company
internal systems need to be brought fwd.scrap logis.	company
quality- needs to be given a greater voice.	company
the development of  site level customer champions to assist with for example areas of continuous improvement will help.	company
using available technology to drive efficiency and reduce manual duplication in the process, especially when it comes to vas	company
i sometimes think we often are too segregated in terms of departments and products making it more difficult for our teams to work together towards developing solid, quality solutions for our customers that will bring us more business.	company
quality of quotations, and operational quality.	company
we are difficult to work with.	company
our customers tell us this, and i experience it in my daily life too.	company
pricing is also not always competitive - especially at the initial quotation stage.	company
unable to provide the necessary focus to drive continuous improvements.	company
who in the business is responsible for successful delivery of the edi solution in a timely manner	company
still, there's no corporate quality management function, let alone an iso certified corporate system.	company
as required by all bus, our group needs a comprehensive integrated management system (strategy)	company
sop is a huge pain area.	company
lack of ownership results in regimpat picking up extra work - customers have complained as it adds delays.	company
please use the following open comment boxes to provide more detail on topics you might want to address. you are a valued employee to us and we welcome your additional thoughts and concerns.	company
i believe we have to way too many internal meetings and activities which take us away from efforts with customers.	company
there is still room for improvement, regarding the service quality we offer.	company
the strategy in customer service doesn't seem to be yet very clear, each country is trying to test different models.	company
need to improve service level and technology	company
in the u.s., we make a profit, but still lose too much business due to operational errors.	company
the operational quality in the usa has to improve further so as to create stronger growth and confidence.	company
need to improve our service quality	company
though steps are being taken to improvise the same, there are areas of improvment, in my opinon its continual improvement, with better productivity.	company
though we have moved a long way from last year, we feel need to improve more on our quality centric towards customer satisfaction may be by way of investing more on technology on track and trace.	company
we need to have a 24 hrs or 48 hrs time line to return the second call .this give customer more faith in our effort .	company
more tech access to people on ground.	company
planning & guide for handling the difficulties need support for error free work .	company
we the [company] team will do the right thing in first time, so that customer get its shipme nts on time without any problem.	company

it system is almost not inexistent	company
very frustrating company to work for  feels like [company] have lost the way,  lost direction,  customer is no longer important  also pricing is still an issue,  not just timescale but pricing is way out	company
face to face meeting with customers to be frequent	company
better understanding of each employees capabilities and their strengths.	company
supervisors/managers should provide adequate support to their team members when new tasks are given and when serious concerns are raised instead of finding faults & demotivating	company
technology based solutions for our customers.	company
product flexibility and market awareness on local level from product teams is behind our competitors large and small.	company
systems will need to be developed further and i think it is under process	company
avoid concentrating on non productive things which is very common in ro, our concentration needs to be in gaining business.	company
more focus is required on diversification - new markets, new products and new lanes.	company
centralized pricing (acc/occ)must understand doe and handling costs when making pricing decisions	company
our sales team are not knowledgeable / talented enough to sell.	company
they were simply too young / lazy to know what [company] can offer, and with very limited experience / knowledge to give customers a professional image of [company].	company
we always need to put ourselves in our bps shoes.	company
i think we need to have a standardize course for us to response to customers query so that we can improve our work.	company
work process needs to be defined clearly and executed.	company
develop work process and procedures for individual job functions so that every one is one the same page and eliminate the doubt and guesses as to what should be done with processes and procedure	company
accuracy and timeliness of the data process.	company
i see a need to remind cdz field customer service and dispatch on helping the customer (internal/external) on the first call or email, rather than sending them to another office because it's not their division/station/revenue/port, etc..	company
our entry quality is still not where it needs to be.	company
accuracy is important and is timely processing.	company
things have improved but there is still room for significant improvement.	company
the handover of an account to a new processor is sometimes lacking.	company
we focus on impat, solid sop's and ensure as much as possible is loaded into our system, but not everything gets passed on; causing errors.	company
we should audit the handover better.	company
our systems that provide information to the customer.	company
they are dated and not always accurate.	company
the customer should be able to track/trace a shipment and be able to tell what status it is in.	company
need more customer  need car barking because barking not enough	company
i feel that we need to sell our product better.	company
we need to educate our customers better.	company
once a poa is secured we need to forward them to the sector that is handling their accounts to educate them as to what they need to clear their shipments.	company
cdz group has improved, but we are still lacking in thinking outside the box and what we can do as a whole group not just as individual groups to provide the customer with quality services.	company
company realized to our own business (profit/loss) prior to long term business and relation without analyze business opportunity.	company

we need to be more focused on client's requirements as a company & be a little more flexible, while the processes are fine sometimes it feels like the employees are more of robots following a process than passionate employee who understand needs.	company
mistakes are repetitive but ignored, although they may only account for 1 - 3% of the business, they are still repetitive mistakes.	company
the products and services and it systems are at best market standard.	company

we are trying to rebuild our company.	company
implementation for exports is terrible and needs to be reviewed	company
systems, we are meant to be global company with global platform	company
the quote system needs to be improved.	company
current system is difficult to understand and is also time consuming which put [company] at a disadvantage.	company
besides, our service is still long.	company
many work lot on process and they overlap in an irregular way.	company
also servicing clients that have special request (which generally leads to greater revenue)  or requirements is difficult when we run on lower staff levels.	company
should be collect data nomination console shipment to improve our revenue	company
more work suppose to be done in this area and all department needs to come on single page to serve our valuable customers	company
our process is too complex as a result we take a long time to get simple things done 2) product to have ownership of customer.	company
taking up the ownership and initiative to address complaints from customers	company
system which cw is fulfilling but will only see the full effect when we go live globally	company
there are many accounts flagged under unassigned sales (meaning there is no sales man handling these customers).	company
all customers (big or small) should have account owners to continuously explore opportunities to grow biz.	company
workload is getting more based on customers demand, customers require to have flight details, awb , coo , dg packing, etc.. within a short time or asap, based on our resources and files produced daily, it is not realistic to please all customers	company
pricing should be align with local markets levels	company
response time to customer, shipment follow up and ownership	company

we need to give more focus on customer requirement, their issues & concern.	company
while [company] is talking about gross profit only.	company
better approach is required.	company
our overall customer service quality still have a lot of room for improvements, where we should strive to be the most customer centric freight forwarder	company
its wrong to reduce our sales when we want to grow our business.	company
i feel that our company is little bit behind in today mobile internet driven environment.	company
i think we can provide our customer with some app for the shipment tracking/order booking/customer service/quotation.	company
develop middle size company's business with good gp  good incentive scheme for pure new business	company
product managers should talk more to the customers directly, accompanied by the sales.	company
we are not dominating the market, so our product should learn market practices and design our products in a smarter and more realistic way.need smart bsa for bc.	company
effective key differentiator for businesses today & strategic advantage.	company
1-  i  think that customer complaint department must not be in the ccv team because many time is difficult to process an ccm as service company with the same team involved because they focus on the person and not for the ccm	company
until irr and it's implementation, i fear will continue to miss opportunities and bleed profit.	company
holding a product accountable for issuing late invoices to chb.	company
no response at times to emails	company
we miss revenue because we do not quote the shipments on time, pickup on time, and respond.	company
we measure number of ccm's but we don't measure ccm content and voice of customer.	company
we don't analyze each ccm find a root cause and fix.	company
also oc and air quotes take too long+ we lose the shipm	company
the complaints of our service are lower; however we struggle to provide the customer service excellence that a #1 freight forwarder should be providing.	company
operations supervisors to be able to make quicker on the spot decisions when our customers call for resolutions to customer complaint's even if the customer becomes irate or confrontational.	company
[company]'s ultimate aim change their negative experience around	company
accountability to make sure there is follow through and be able to pin down the specific person involved so we can improve our processes and capabilities.	company
invoicing is very big problem and leads to customer dissatisfaction even if shipments are handled well.	company
how collection calls are handled upset customers.	company
there are way too many different stations/teams that touch a file and this tends to delay air and ocean shipments.	company
empowerment for employees to work cross-product and solve problems regardless of product/division or service group.	company
better pricing from aspa, competitors have been much better for 2017	company
direction of the company.	company
local leadership changes over past decade have been contradictory leading us in different directions each time with no real progress made from one era to the next.	company

many of the larger stations still require 2nd or 3rd requests to take necessary actions for items that would be considered normal operations.	company
a push to our roots of being problem solvers for our customers.	company
i think response time to calls and emails should have a set standard to ensure we are serving our customers to our best ability	company
customer account transitions and implementation are still a struggle.	company
obtaining accurate and timely feedback from the stations to our customer must improve.	company
far too many 2nd and 3rd and even 4th requests are required to get information.	company
resources allocation needs to be improve	company
i recognize that there are areas for improvement and will definitely work on the same.	company
peoples attitute to customers (intercompany colleagues) and service quolity.	company
system things, too much manual work, that could be done automatically or on easier way.	company
1) to improve internal strusture and omit odd functions  2) to strength legal support in claims handling	company
1.evaluation of productivity data to allow 'growth through quality & efficiency' to be realistic.	company
2.quality of new business implementation.	company
constant reminder for eomployees to act in accordance with the strategy.	company
probably create a more attainable and simple guidelines how to reach and deliver quality, sense of freight ownership should be strongly inculcated or put into practice..	company
with cargowise and growth in volumes and reduced fte we are facing big escalations which have impact on further growth.	company
we still have too much difficult (internal) procedures what makes it for many employees complicated to give excellent customer services to our customers.	company
better communications with our customers is what needs to be improved, especially when they request information or an update.	company
that have little or no effect on service improvements at operations level that directly effect the customer needs / wants.	company
need to look at resource and re-allocation of fte	company

cross-sectional training, understanding each other's business, csi integration should be a culture not a business unit.	company
we need to find more sales leads and continue to build the bvusiness	company
but we facing form with air export customer service which need to be immproved.	company
also we need to develop in ar.	company
there is always a room for improvement in this area.	company
we can focus on customers along with making our internal relation strong among colleagues.	company
need much improvement for online tracking shipment and update.	company
also need to maintain a proper track of shipments and update	company
the service quality offered by us is below standard at the moment and customer is relying on the brand name only.	company
there needs to be ownership and help team members particularly in customer service & ops to works as one team	company
we still far behind to keep our customer happy who is base of our business and make this profitable .	company
we revert to customers mail in a very pro-active manner.	company
every one in this organization need to be passionate about work and the most important think is to have better resource for customer and as well as for employees	company
allowing flexibility in the japan it policy for business intelligence software such microsoft visual studio and autoit would be beneficial .	company
rule, regulation, require need check with diff interface.	company
if it can centralize into one interface will be better.	company
[company] has lost its charm.	company
getting more rigid and in-flexible.	company
quality of service deteriorating.	company
spend lot of time discussing and each one pulling in different direction leading to no timely decision	company
profitable not looking at shipment as one file.	company
i feel their is strong need of inter department discussions on failures.	company
operations / products in both airfreight and ocean freight must try to alien in accordance to the service requirements of the customers in the present era.	company
serving to customer should increase a lot, if any issue raised first point we found is who has done the mistake and how to forward the issue on other dept.	company
rather solving the issue and later finding fault.	company
every employee should understand their responsibility and perform their job by practicing the core values every day to achieve the vision of most customer centric logistic company.	company
1) need to improve our it and visiblity of airlines schedules arrival and depature date and customs/aai irregularities  2) visiblity of customer mail id in logis remarks to contact customer immediately upon arrival	company

what possible and what not possible.	company
need to improve our invoicing to customers.	company
need to understand and support our customer's needs effectively.	company
alignment across all products and regions focusing on total customer opportunity, not looking at it in isolation on what exists at a specific country / product level.	company
"instead of ""kick the ball down the rd"" syndrome due to silo approach."	company
we need to study and use more advance technology in order to improve operations efficiency and reduce human error	company
districts are working in their own interests, not one team/brand focus.	company
the existing organization structure is the greatest barrier to provide better service to customer.	company
our churn impact is very high.	company
regional procurement of ofr rates, it's not adapted to the reality in each country and the attainment of csi/mnc businesses.	company
i would like to increase stronger people	company
tracking system  billing system  too many emails  communication	company
e.g. air, ocean, domestic, brokerage.	company
all the systems need to talk to each other.	company
[company] needs to avoid so much manual work.	company
like data entry from one system to another.	company
we need to improve in our quality, that has to star with having the best people of the industry.	company
management of exceptions, communication with clients, tolerance for errors, simplification of processes.	company
we have over complicated our approach and it is not complicated, it is the basic function we have provide to our customer.	company
some of them would like regular contact and face to face meetings that makes the feel that they are valued partner our business	company
customer service at key gateways  turn around time for adhoc quotes/simply process where possible  for us...implementation of travel restrictions early in the year....tough on sales teams and other marketing activities	company
overall streamlining and remove layers (m&s and product) to establish clear responsibilities/accountability and enhance decision making process/empowerment.	company
quotes take several days.	company
customer service suffers sometimes because some teams are too rigid & aren't flexible in what they require or willingness to help.	company
service quality and ownership	company
hot water should be available every time it get spoiled in every one week.	company
reinforcing ownership and encourage the us of our available resources to improve our overall operational end to end process internally.	company
sales, we need new customers.	company
technology is behind.	company
internal processes are too cumbersome and difficult.	company
it is hard to do business with us at times.	company
afr & ofr need to quote all opptys, period.	company
process, shipmts lost in transitions.	company
station answer the phone.	company
ops need to call cust, not just email.	company
atl and mia are terrible at responding to customer's emails and phone calls.	company
our customers constantly criticize those stations for not answering the phones and not returning calls or emails.	company
creation of a single global operating platform.	company
streamlining and simplifying our global sales reporting  system, and then linking it to our global operating platform eventually.	company
this applies to non csi level.	company
quote turn times from all afr and ocean regional centers.	company
travel ban for bdkam, lift it!	company
operations as a whole is missing the target, this includes pricing teams and customer service teams.	company
better reporting that reflects accurate complete information on their shipments when an account does not have a program manager to scrub reports.	company
service is uneven across network.	company
service is geared around largest customers and not smaller accounts which make growth difficult	company
i am experiencing positive and gradual improvement in most of the areas , so there would be nothing to be pointed out in a separate way.	company
all the bricks are been covered and its moving ahead in a better way.	company
in short, changes are happening and yet mor	company
instead of dividing in to the process vise, country wise team is best for error free processing. when we process toi jobs for all country we may get lot of errors. so country specific is best one for good customer maintaining.	company
we have to improve process to deliver quotes on time  road freight transportation (more quality providers)	company
information readiness should be faster.	company
overall accuracy for whole process should be improved.	company
need to focus on customers expectation and not on tat	company
we should improve our quality for better service	company
"great deal of emphasis on acquiring new hvt business which is absolutely necessary for growth, but not enough sales time allotted to maintaining mid-size""house"" a/c.cssv often take lead in maintaining this type of a.c - there s/b closer sales contact"	company
there needs to be more product / services awareness campaigns.	company
sales folk are inundated with simply selling	company
- information on mbr reporting not correct.	company
need assistance from it specialist / operations to insert correct information when processing shipments.	company
in our organisation our clients come last and not one department is united in working to make the client happy and have a great experience with [company].	company
data integrity on reports to clients	company
we need to fully focus on the customer their needs and concerns.	company
eliminate non productive tasks and kpi's.	company
we need to spend more time taking in the feedback provided by our customer base and develop plans & actions around the comments being shared with us.	company
employee refocus on the processes and quality	company
smt must act more than talk.	company
also if we need to improve gp, we must improve our service level.	company
we need to make things correct first time ie billing our customer correctly to avoid credit notes and by doing this our customers will have more confidence in our company.	company
respect for one another, quality of handling operations by virtue of pro-activeness, delay by finance in paying transporters who deliberately now delaying/playing double games to give trucks to [company]-ug,sales support for achieving max.selling time	company
advise customer the need for warehousing to avert demurrage against every shipment that are ready for delivery, while waiting for delivery instruction.	company
due to price hike and issues on transportation at the port, we need to buy our own trucks or set up a more organised transport team to improve our delivery timeline to avoid loosing valuable customers.	company
we also need a regular sales commission scheme.	company
we cannot continue to engage the market based on price alone.	company
we do not primarily control a lot of freight shipment, hence we need to review our offerings in country to be differentiated from other ffs and the local agents.	company
there has been improvements on our operations as well , but however there is still a lot to be done.there are still some delays in operations which customers are complaining about, and on which we are working on.	company
the communication between the areas to be able to meet beyond the expectations of the clients.	company
cost control measures should be put put in place such projects like continuous process improvement plans should be reviewed	company
the accounting department : to change their behaviors when they talk to the clients (not to be aggressive, and speak in gentle & positive way).	company
to follow up and turnback to customer , either track and trace needs to be improved more professionally.	company
1) today not all afr regions contribute their share in the new hop bid process  2) commitment to support each other across teams / regions  3) lacking recognition (if good) & accountability (if bad)	company
motivate people with recognition and appreciation for the extra mile work.	company
suggest to get more better visibility for customers on their shipments.	company
lack of commitment with existing customer not giving the necessary attention,for their maintenance.difficulty in retaining/won new customers,we never present the first best option/solution.usual delay in sending proposals/solutions afr or ofr	company
a clear strategy and a clear understanding of what we are willing to loose on the customer side to get to where we want to be.	company
possibility to offer our customers 100% tracing visibility and sending customs documents/invoices electronically ehf/ebilling.	company
-we need to work even more for the whole company to understand the meaning of customer satisfaction and this being linked to several kpis (eg.	company
we as a [company] have to serve the seme quality in all countries..	company
global data information - rates and products	company
we need to review the biz process and audits ( iso 2000, 9001) would help.	company
in hinterland markets; company needs to be bit flexible i.e.	company
operations both for air and ocean needs to be improved.	company
there are constant changes in the strategy.	company
the annual appraisal is very poor.	company
need many changes still the way we function.	company
we need to put our basics in place very strongly .	company
customer should not struggle for basic requirements like pre alert / shipment status  / invoice / draft bl/ debit note etc .	company
sustainability of process thru monitoring for a longer period rather than short term kpi goals.	company
any it development/ changes should be done by keeping in view on the future requirements rather than just quick-fixes fully understanding the current operational process and geographic requirements..	company
the commercial sense at all levels needs to improve to recognize that we are in business and need to constantly work on reducing costs and maximizing profits	company
in our business customer's satisfaction is must ..but most of the time we are communicating via mail or phone ..but not meeting face to face this will create more bonding.	company
while we do and give our best to customer to wow them, we should also try and educate the teams engaged with customers to speak to customers in a polite language that there would be a cost for any thing done/given which were not originally agreed for	company
customer demands are more increasing now a days, hence we need to equip our systems more efficient and simplified.	company
being customer centric organization is important, but it is also adding lot of pressure on the resources since we don't have efficient systems and processes.	company
need back support to get the shipment cleared without any difficulties	company
relevant information that has to be input into the system to ship never finds its way onto delivery notes simple things like shippers names reference numbers etc	company
there still remains a lack of accountability.	company
instead, issues are brushed off.	company
sales team need support on bring in more business.	company
it's worrying that the strategy to become a customer-oriented company is not well defined and that it's increasingly getting weaker in quality issues and with this i don't mean iso standards, but continuous improvement.	company
one person execute several functions in each project.	company
the workload reduce the quality of the processes and the final delivery of the product.	company
client invoicing arrives late and incomplete.	company
the client implementation process needs to improve a lot.	company
this is a service company and as long as the topic is not solved, whether it is with more resources or by improving the process, more focused on the client, nothing will change, even if you put more bosses or more first choice processes that don't work.	company
make quotes more effective and eliminate the quantity of systems we use to do the same task, this takes up time and requires a lot more resources.	company
regional communications and tasks are usually very disperse and require a double and a triple effort because we are requested the same information on several fronts in different formats for the same project.	company
we need to improve the service quality to our customers.	company
current system infrastructure need to improve.	company
sometime we are not competing in the market as well as other companies.	company
our strategy is confusing - 2017 is the year of winusa but at the same time, the us have enforced travel bans and hiring freeze.	company
cif encourage employees to think outside of the box and be innovative, but at the same time we keep making more silo ops.	company
combination of sales and operational support to work together as a team on gaining and maintaining accounts.	company
with new customers coming onboard, it would be great to get some more support in the form of new positions that can take on some of the workload so that we do not end up neglecting some of our smaller but profitable customers.	company
too many product managers/directors interfere with operations; ops managers answer to too many ppl as result  too many managers/directors - they create work for desk level agents, takes focus away from active shipments	company
still have a somewhat dogmatic approach on standardizing certain aspects across the board and not acknowledging when exceptions should be made	company
make decision that are business sound for [company].	company
i think we just need to continue to recover our brand.	company
there is still a lot of negative about [company] in the marketplace in the us.	company
with the need to complete so many reports timely, almost seems we are losing track of the most important part of our  reason for work, our customer/ service!	company
occ - feel that a pricing person should be at every station to understand the best way to quote a customer.	company
it facility need to be improve	company
the hr team in particular should be able to give us a feedback of the concern we have.	company
that the answer time be quicker.	company
our implementation process is laborious and inefficient.	company
we need to focus on ease of business rather than putting barriers in the way of getting customers.	company
there is no integration of operating systems(sales, afr, ofr, brokerage)	company
need more new customer especially for air export.	company
i think that even we are already working hard on improving quality and consistency, we still have to reach a higher level in order to be excellent.	company
simplification and standarization is critical to improve effenciency and reduce cost.	company
sales account management structure too heavy and too many people in front of customers that are not enough familiar with products and consequently focus on rates.	company
[company] mgmt doesn't invest enough where many customer issues lie... at the station level.	company
quality is sacrificed for profit.	company
give more priority to the client's needs, becauseÂ many points are sometimes not heard inside the procedure chain, since the information is not obtained as soon as possible so that the client has the status of his cargo.	company
e.g. air freight in united states.	company
in us local sales is needed to spur sme growth [company] needs to bundle products better for commercial growth.	company
we need more on-line tools for customers to request products, rates, on-line bookings capabilities etc.	company
in all customer visibility tools needs to be further rolled-out and enhanced.	company
sometimes we think only on financial results, we need to find the point in which we and our customers can achieve common succes.	company
the feedback that i receive from my customers is that they expect that [company] looking for a solution, but sometimes (for bc customers) we have a big delay to return with a simple information to them.	company
a better defined service menu.	company
customers want to know what options they have and what the transit time will be.	company
when will it move, and when will it deliver is most important to them.	company
useful tools for customers to be able to have data on time	company
we need to improve our service quality to can improving [company]	company
need to focus more on our customers needs	company
all individuals understanding that they need to own a problem and resolve.	company
too many large e-mail chains.	company
we need to grow our volumes and play in a niche / different space, we don't capitalise on our sectors and expertise and therefore sell too cheaply	company
customers need to be further considered when making choices based on money saving - shipping lines are a prime example, i feel we have lowered our service standards to save money and this is affecting our customers.	company
quick actions required to recover the misrouted shipments.	company
customs as its not air or ocean freight is often seen not focused or seen within our business.	company
as a result customs is growing however lacks resource to receive its objectives for continued growth.	company
teams work in silo's and therefore we cannot expect to keep up with the competition if we don't talk and share market intelligence from our customers.	company
more sales people selling not managing	company
service deficiencies involving our overseas network and usa in particular	company
although we may be customer centric and quality leader, we must not compromise on our profitability nor make our company loose money due to poor / ineffective costing.	company
need to encourage the same.	company
the demotivation is clear.comments and actions i've seen don't benefit the company and the business.people avoid office environment, complain about management and decisions taken.managers need to lead by example, hr to get more involved w/ employees	company
the company focuses too much energy/time on useless things.	company
we all must be engaged and try to overcome all difficulties we are passing now to get stability.	company
giving [name] on a rainy day is not particularly my idea of an employee centric company.	company
we have lot of activities on the floor internally and externally from hr and also within the service line afr which really motivates everyone.	company
this is one of major area of concern for all the employees, there is lot of improvement required in our location.	company
resources, daily 10%-20% overtime without any compensation.	company
this is constant, not temporal.	company
looks like all interesting available positions, uk, india,reg middle east etc are  exclusively reserved to ho bonn team.	company
sometimes we faced that the commercial owner is not really engaged with the team.	company
they do not provide full information about the customer or the business.	company
"we are not tackling the true source of some of the issues we face and using desk staff as a "" sticking plaster "" fix."	company
lot of changes in [company] that affect negatively the employee engagement as it create uncertainty	company
not to take from current, but it should be based on new role and location.	company
too complex, too many measures, not one direction.	company
the engagement of the employee would be better, if we give them the time and space for new developments	company
more entrepreneurship in the countries in hr.. as long as the numbers are hitting the targets more room for strategic investments should be in the countries.	company
regional and head offices are often too distant to understand the dynamics and opportunties	company
engagement: there is a lot of hard and complex work done in managment preparing strategies and roadmap.	company
but when it comes to engage resources this is far from optimal - important topics are just kicked off on the back of an email, nothing further	company
please continue to develop the qualities of [company] members at all levels in the topics related to human, natural, commercial, etc.	company
"programs like the cif should not be a one in a ""career lifetime"" experience, there should be regular support programs to ensure asimilation of all the concepts provided there."	company

we don't have engagement at the levels required to implement sustainable solutions.	company
there is a poor culture of accountability at all levels which has a substantial cumulative impact across the company.	company
actions from last years (2016) eos need to be implemented before new ones from eos 2017 are discussed.	company

topics like the fact that we would like people's seniority to be taken into account and valued by the company.	company
carrier path is really not shown clearly in [company].	company
the company need to be more relevant with employee's carrier plan and lead them more often	company
still too many stake holders to decide on each topic.	company
eom selection needs to be improved	company
one of the biggest motivations for workers is salary.sometimes the company managers don't see good workers whose salary must be raised ,even without worker ask.that is why people that must be appreciated,leave the company or work less efective.	company
highlight the importance of every colleague in the company to encourage them	company
6 years with the company and i still don't know the next role that i can become capable for.	company
maybe a little more clarity at top management level on how their actions impact downline even though intentions may be good.	company
also, expectations from employees need to be aligned with practical realities.	company
leadership is engaging the  team to take feedback and make changes accordingly	company
in general, in the last years there has been a lack of leadership, valuable people have left the company and this has some weight on the people that continue to be loyal to [company].	company
i think it's a cultural topic of the country but we could put more effort into seeing things from a global perspective and not stay with very specific cases.	company
i think constant improvements are not valued.	company
contracts in logis have to be updated seems like nothing is in the contracts anymore or not updated correctly hence cca's and more cca'ssalespeople need to learn the process from the pickup point and what services..like dg and perishable mean...	company

our company always separate each group staff	company
nothing in my opinion needs to be improved	company
need to listen to employees and their input	company
senior management needs to have a better understanding of how the desk level employees work and what is involved in the day to day operations	company
interstation communications and response times.	company
overall outing for respective branch is happening now.	company
it would have been nice to hear in different ways from senior management.	company

"the continued ""retread"" of senior executives to new jobs without new leaders emerging or joining is damaging to the health of the company"	company
provide more interactions/engagements with employees specially when it comes to our needs and necessities.	company
employee engagement might need to add, to help building team work and employee relationship, as well as activity help individual to free up themselves from stressful work daily.	company
what we need to improved is to have a more people for our team.	company
employee engagement helps us in a work life balance, this should be done always at least twice a month.	company

tiring more for the employee and jobs rotation, more development c that can help and keep our employee	company
new strategies need to be sought to strengthen employees' sense of belonging with the organization.	company
engagement with safety standards and protocols.	company
turn over trend is going high and we are facing a big threat of losing high potentials from our talent pool due to inflation and low salaries.	company
we need to reconsider the salary adjustment mechanism in cases of promotion as it doesn't help management.	company
we need to have the feeling that we are important to the company that we are effective and we can grow inside the company	company
there could be programmes designed to get every employee more involved and contributing with their own ideas.	company
the company needs to reward staff for the hard work and efforts they put in	company
though efforts have been put into place for employees to engage, there is still a mindset present of where there is a divide between different departments.	company
a new sense of urgency needs to be focused and driven down through the organisation.	company
decisions making and initiative needs to be encouraged at operational levels.	company
management update on project, financials, directions need to be provided regularly and promptly	company
point structure of the process should be changed on the basis of criticality and skill required.	company

faster recruitment process	company
good communication can improve efficiency	company
strategys and plans from the company sometimes dont go to the employees because those managers change the priorities without clear purposes.	company
train middle leaders more so that they can manage and direct better.	company
"key pillar of [company] ârespect"" is not adhered by [name] which leads to demotivation"	company
problem is user is pain for me in team also she is influencing others.	company
info comes from the employees than the reporting manager.no clear involvement in the processes iam handling, need to have skips which has not happened at all	company
senior leadership must lead with examples worth learning from.	company
which leads to comparison and dissatisfaction.	company
long-term employees are partially being treated in a disrespectful manner.	company
experience resource should manage to deliver is efficient.	company
there remains an attitude that even with the very bleak financial outlook , people from the top down are still refusing to look within for efficiencies.	company
too many are still protecting old ways of doing things which clearly cannot continue.	company
instead of finding opportunities to improvise, optimize and innovate which will reduce costs, focus is on getting quick costs cutting thru employee benefits or headcounts.	company
clear focus & strategy instead of daily firefight.	company
appears to be focusing on empire building rather than improving quality and deliverables.	company
tick box driven regardless of content.	company
management decisions that are erratic and seem arbitrary, at times.	company
where it does not genuinely show, it can create distrust and distraction, which we do not need.	company
the global bid team has gone through a recent restructuring which most of the team members do not agree with, but this was signed off by senior mgmt w/o direct input from the team.	company
they are constantly trying to get back at or find ways to reprimand the employees that report directly to them.	company
the ideas and areas being developed will not create a successful company.	company
no type of active leadership or strategy from cenac's top management is seen, therefore, changes that the company requires in financial topics won't be made in the short term.	company
feedback to cem's regarding change of reporting has been poor, no communication for several months.	company
lack of information shared at the start of a new project.	company
senior management to understand how long it actually takes from shipment to admin & see why it takes so long to bill & close each file (see different examples) .	company
also stop 'sucking up' to certain staff members its so obvious no names need to be mentioned, its cringe.	company
staff morale  internal processes need to be simplified  its important to have the right people in the right jobs	company
we need management, we need plans to improve.	company
we need to win customers back, we need account managers to know rates, reply to emails.	company
customers can hear this & does not give good impression.	company
negative colleagues not spoken to- but encouraged  unpleasant environment.	company
speed in execution of actions as agreed	company
more sensitive approach while restructuring / transforming [company].	company
each time a new direction has to be followed; new procedures to adhere to, new colleagues to get to know.. once all is in place, a successor is again appointed.	company
one step forward, 2 back..	company
approval processes for (small) investments are still cumbersome.	company
too many approvals steps needed that do not add value and only delay.	company
meeting customer expectations therefore becomes always challenging	company
personal development in order to become a better professional towards the customer or even within the company	company
- more planning/structure, less fire fighting  - clear vision how we as team contribute to company's success  - set clear prios what we want to achieve & what need to stop, esp.	company
due to resource constraints  - more regular team mtgs	company
unfortunately, this is often neglected.	company
examples here are unclear expectations, bad rewards that are acknowledged but not changed.	company
with the upcoming cost-cutting program, the standards we reached will, to a great extent, be destroyed again.	company
it doesn't make sense to optimize ebit/ gp conversion without adjusting the resources and processes, accordingly, without taking into account the goals we set ourselves.	company
a real growth project (reducing cost, doe is not a project to create excitment in the company)  the senior management support to evolve, to think broadly about successions	company
leading by example.	company
internal support and cooperation between the areas.	company
management need to walk the talk  stop putting profit above employee engagement and employee security as we have had enough cuts already  top management tier structure needs improvement	company
we can still further improve recognition of good performance	company
too many priorities at the same time	company
senior management at [company] chase topics like a group of school children with a football.	company
there has been seemingly no clear strategy for a number of years, hence every new topic is seemingly viewed as revolutionary and to be grasped with both hands.	company
leadership clearly was enhanced comparing with the last years but it is a topic that we have margin of improvements and cooperation between different areas/regions.	company
the recruitment process needs a fundamental overhaul - ceo's wasting time on low level resource approvals is not the right use of senior management time.	company
i think management needs to be improved.	company
there are a lot of good employees that have left the company solely because of management.	company
all the employees, especially the ground level should be considered and consulted while making general company policies.	company
securities are unnecessarily getting involved on operational activities & they are sending videos for small incidents which can be avoided.cotrol room is not required unnecessary wasting our money.salary to be revised according to living expense.	company
new lockers required at changing room.staffs who are working more than 5 years has to be awarded/recognised.quality of the safety shoes need to be improved & frequency has to be increased.winter jackets to be provided for those who areworking outside	company
we don't have freedom to work securities are unnecessarilly getting involved on operational activities & vides are forwarded for small issuues unnecessarilly.	company
we need storng and effective leadership & we need free transpotion & two days off weekly i requst all danzas staff receiving ingriment but iam not receiving we allso need ingriment hr only lestening manager wards but theae is no more personal enquies	company
most social gathering turn out to be a tick in box than creating genuine social interactions.	company
standard process of seeking promotion should have some knowledge of the actual job function.	company
csa suggestion needs to be part of process development	company
in one year maganers has chaange 3 times all have little or no experience in what customer service does focussing on minor issue internally and not acknowleging efforts being made by those who actually give it there all.	company
"leadership needs to have a proper communication with its constituents, we need to stop this ""fear"" mongering wherein they are abusing their position, instead of inflicting ""fear"" to his/her subordinates, why don't we just sit down and communicate."	company
quick and proper information	company
all things are ok, but in my guess for the new people the main leadership should be able to train all the floor activity and daily activity that is request :)	company
many people need to be replaced, stronger, quicker decision is the need of the hour	company
trust and empower countries!	company
perhaps, best demonstrated practices implemented to achieve great eos results may be shared.	company
on occasions expectancy levels are too high and put huge pressure on teams and individual  some more structure and forward planning for these times would be greatly appreciated  also more understanding on  different accounts in the absence of others	company
currently there is a lack of resources and i am struggling to keep up with my day to day workload.	company
leadership - senior management need to engage with staff more on a day to day basis.	company
more positivity: remove the fear factor if people make a mistake.	company
senior management need to lead by example and take an interest in what everyone does, not just people they like!	company
consistency amongst managers - i.e.	company
better team management/supervision is needed across the board	company
people managers need to be consistent in their approach to team members and company policies are applied the same across.	company
take time to listen to their team and address performance issues and also provide positive feedback to those doing a well.	company
sometimes investment in your own people/service is a crucial key to develop which is essential to growth, evolving and proceeding.	company
but before we can adapt that mentality as one company, an example must be set from the smt.	company
lead with respect and example, treat all employees in the same way.	company
that all employees have the opportunity to get training.	company
decisions should not only based on his/her own perspective.	company
this creates a culture where people much rather step aside and let the sr. managers become the decision makers.	company
old leadership and the old guard must make way for fresh young managerial talent and new ideas and ways of carrying on day to day functions.	company
lack of management support towards staffs	company
understand them  company [company] is best , providing growth opportunity.	company
senior management should not over look efforts of employees who work silently and do not blow their own trumpets like others, who get highlighted and opportunity to grow.	company
hard and smart workers backstage do not get opportunity to grow.	company
sales strategy seems scattergun approach.	company
ocean procurement does not seems to be leveraging our position as 2nd largest freight forwarder in best way to position us to win bc business.	company
some of smaller competitors are getting better rates.	company
basic pay for territory sales managers we are paid well below market value currently	company
constant changes and no clear instructions from management, causing frustration and lack of motivation.	company
i feel that in sales we have too many different directions and directives, leading to no clear direction or vision.	company
are permitted to influence our workload and remove focus from the goal of selling, gaining and keeping business	company
the management needs to improve!i dont understand how we keep gaining new roles of ceo's every year or so?	company
perhaps the company should consider developing our internal team that is best fit for the job than recruiting an outsider that has no idea.	company
in case of emergency management should look after employee safety and reaching home as early as possible	company
- more respect from senior management  - our opinions are not taken into consideration  - management makes preferences between employees and decisions are biased based on this.	company
some bias decisions based on preferences  3.	company
he manager should be manner man .	company
we require an open minded leadership and willing to accept everyone's opinion and act on them, as we are the one who are doing the work and we know the struggles that we are facing, do not just implement a process base on statistics alone.	company
also the supervisors should be open to changes and feedback and also ideas which could bring about a change in the department.	company
leaders need to firm in identify good performers as well as bad performers and confident to propose whatever follow up plan for them	company
basically in uae most of the local company's working days is 5 days in a week but [company] is the one of largest logistics company in the world so as a [company] employee i am expecting 5 days working for all [company] staff in uae.thanks	company

our management involve staff in processes and gives clear goals	company
company culture needs to adopt towards the [company] ground rules	company
it exists a feeling in the company that bad financial results will lead to loosing jobs.	company
in [company] we still use paper-based vacation sheets to get approved, we need to change to portal-based solutions.	company
middle management leaders need to be open to change.	company
open to trying new ways to do things.	company
also, they need to be more responsive.	company
there is a lack of urgency at times.	company
the management should deep dive and understand the challenges face by the employees in their work force, and help/support them for improvement plan.	company

in the company i feel that the leadership and team formation topic is the most important point if the numbers and results want to be improved.	company
communication still remains an area that needs great improvement within isc.	company
still remains silent in some instances.	company
we need to hear more from local management.	company
sr management communication is lacking, respect is diminished, spirit of cooperation is decreased and engaging mid level management is poor	company

communication from 2nd level management is lacking, mainly because we do not have a full-time 2nd level manager.	company
i hope this improves once a replacement is in place.	company

management needs to be changed or else it will effect employee or agents within the company.	company
leave planning should be more effective and working staff should be utilize correctly.	company
changes in operations decisions should be benefited to employee and should be based on employees decision.	company
active leadership (lead by example)	company
individual improvement, future development.	company
the managers should be actively involved in new projects in order to motivate other employees by setting good examples.	company
"- customer centricity throughout the business is poor  - active leadership is poor with what seems to be a closed door policy and very little regard for employee's on the ground  - [company] global policy is often the ""reason"" blamed for decisions"	company

there is a rift between air  and ocean	company
more focus on commercial building/improvements needed.	company

need to open their eyes to see the productivity in the team.	company
employee development towards the opportunity to work in new project;  balance between kpis and country context;  appreciation of employee effort towards their goal achievement and recognition of smt on staff effort.	company
there is still room for improvement in what touches active leadership.	company
i feel that our leaders must know what each one is doing in terms of challenges and strengths.	company
our supervisors should walk the talk, lead by example	company
the right thing for some leaders would be to improve their respect for employees (a greeting is essential) and engagement with the company, giving a neutral environment for their employees and not showing preferences, which are notorious amongst the staff in charge.	company
one who appreciates staffs efforts, who gives everyone room to share ideas and listen.	company
continue the same strategy	company
people-oriented senior management that will take care of their staff and resolve issues.	company
management needs to improve on taking strategic decision and work on expanding the business.	company

"my leader is a bit like a ""machine"" himself and therefore i miss some more understanding for personal issues especially - as the pressure in our department is high on each employee."	company
now nothing needs to be improved because everything goes in a good direction,	company
focus on generating the right business which is regular and profitable.	company
cut costs where there is no value add, ro and go we have senior resources with no business additions to bottom line.	company
frequent changes in leadership need to be fix.	company

3 things stop this company from moving forward.	company
people don't feel that they are worth anything just a number  need more positive feedback to the warehouse rather than always negative	company
i feel that management is biased to certain employees.	company
direct supervision needs to be more involved when it comes to holding the truckers accountable and being aware of the overall operations and less hesitant as it relates to truckers not meeting deadlines.	company
workload balancing, my perception may be clouded by my limited information in this area.	company
management is out of the office (with no access to phone or email) more than operations employees, which leaves us to delay important decisions.	company
"holding mgr's accountable, lots of mgr's have it very ""cush"" in pdx leaving the workload to their team and not being available to assist when necessary.it almost feels corrupt as the lower level employees work hard to make the operation work."	company

treating employees with respect, listing others opinion and not discounting others effort.	company
making decision what is right for the company.	company
goodleader have hearts,guts,humility,and expertise in their fields of work.yes,leaders are developed through constant exposure in the field,but it should be for a short span of time,yet if it doesn't work it is not for them to continue in the process	company

management is sometimes rude, uncooperative, very bias sometimes...lots of gossip happens on floor which creates negativity...employees should be taught how to behave on floor...some employees harass girls in team..behavior of employees should imprv	company
some tls favor only particular fte's in the group and take decisions as per those fte's opinions.	company
focus from the top.	company

the service centre could be included in new projects.	company
i think that hr has lost it's shine a little bit, because a few years ago they have stopped doing some events and / or fairs, this way they are loosing their proximity to the collaborators.	company
still too many priorities for the front line guys.	company
sometimes same departments are assigned various projects/objectives from different project streams yet applying to the same people making it really hard for them to cope & achieve all targets.	company
leader/manager should give equal opportunity to internal candidates to work in different area.	company
quality needs to be improved.	company
i feel having sop's posted around the areas they are used at will bring a more clear, precise idea of what is required to all employees.	company
direct manager needs to take a more active roll in the day to day work.	company
management and supervisors have shown preferential treatment to other employees, not addressed several incidences of bullying and have lied on several occasions to suit their own agenda.	company
spot market is almost non existent in imports.	company
lack of an immediate supervisor/manager means short to long term issues and strategies have fallen by the way side.	company
senior management team are doing what they can currently, however it feels like we have been cut adrift these last few years.	company
communication  lead by example	company
company should not forget to care for staff more while focusing on saving cost.	company
management is taking shortcuts under pressure and it reflects on the quality of work.	company
strong business development for afr specifically, focus on business development, visible actions which are showing respect for all levels of employee in the company, needs to drive this from country smt & ctma level.	company
during tough times, leaders need to take difficult decisions but still with professionalism and integrity, which, unfortunately, is not the case of our function lead.	company
the local smt should work with consultative approach which should be acceptable by the entire smt rather then top down approach by single individual.	company
this singular approach leads to demotivation within the teams	company
not allowed to take decisions  lots of micro-management  speaks disrespectfully among team  lack of transparency within the team  inconsistent thought process	company
1.compensation revision should be linked to performance ratings.	company
leader for my department need to be very clear what is important for his/her subordinate.	company
encouragement should be there if some one is performing well and motivation is missing in the department.	company
2)clarity on performance growth	company
employee governance like time swapping  details, leave applications, leave planning ,seat utilisation needs to be streamlined.	company
rather than being biased, the managers should be neutral and give equal opportunity to all in the team.	company
team members should be given opportunity to speak their mind rather than being injected with the ideas of the senior managers.	company
can't save your way to success, seems focus should be on growth and utilizing current cost structure to support that growth (seems we have the capacity to do so).	company
the network is built.	company
the future is still not certain and the strategy not firm enough...	company
2- reporting tools should be more developped and visible by clients  as well as managment  3-invest and embrace the technology and choose systems that serves our purposes.	company
lack of creativity	company
the company needs a deep change.	company
change of the management, change of habits.	company
employees need to be liable, for the mistakes that they made.	company
oftentimes we have so many topics with which to focus and all seem to have priority.	company
continuous development of the people not only on the soft skills side but also on the core business so we can support our bps better.	company
hr teams to be more neutral and objective during important decisions making stage.	company
we seem to be less competitive overall and as a market leader i do not feel our strategy allows up to maintain our position.	company
digital platforms and technological advancements must be invested in to ensure we do not become dinosaurs.	company
more focus on efficiency gains, less on cost cutting	company
when a product is set to be sunset, and another new product is to take the place of it, but the new product does not support the proper features.	company
still to many local applications per countries.	company
plesae stop asking for more it cost reduction and start investing into the future, people cannot work on new technology if all their times are consumed to find marginal savings that is not significantly contributing to company success.	company
resource constraints and resource cutbacks make it difficult to achieve all senior management priorities.	company
information security is not taken seriously by all product owners.	company

invest in it capabilities to provide services to customer and optimize execution (resources, tooling, r&d)	company
a change in management is required; the people who continually are selected to lead the company have no background in forwarding and it shows in their strategy and actions taken.	company
product, operations, cssv, sales & marketing.	company
hope actions being taken now will support need for harmonious working environment.	company
intense gp focus in competition with entrepreneurial solutions.	company

this needs to be address with utmost urgency.	company
our ocean freight product does not change or evolve.	company
getting new clients/contracts is vital but it would be appreciated if implementation and operations teams were more involved in the process, i.e.	company
our systems are very old fashioned and not very functional.	company
the billing process is atrocious.	company

"from strong top-down management and (nfe-times) back to ""empowering the countries""(under [name]) now it seems to be back to strong global leadership."	company
i am concerned that a strict focus on ebit may send out a message that other key business issues are not as important or do not need to be addressed if they have associated cost or may affect ebit.	company
i feel if we continue as we are with the interim manager then i see there's a bright future for the branch.	company
in order to evolve we must change.	company
software being used is 20+ years out of date, leading to a change in work procedures to make up for the weakness in the software.	company

follow the 10 basic rules laid out by the ceo	company
remove eos from bonus system, it has become a routine and it prevents from taking real actions now - managers don't dare anymore since afrait of impact on personal bonus...	company
within [company], we need to be more self-confident overall and have a more positive attitude towards the challenges ahead.	company
we are the biggest forwarder in the world and we can beat competition.	company
the agressive doe decrease can be highly demotivating if not done well and not the best approach.	company
i am a bit worried about our company's future.	company
[company] is making changes (e.g.	company
irr/se, upgrade to tms) that were well overdue so only bringing us to market level, but not yet raising [company] above the competition for the future.	company
the work flow between it, sales and business need to be more aligned	company
having to keep hearing our country continues to not do well does not give me a good feeling of long term security.	company
security is not only an internal practice it is a product that [company] should market.	company
more communication about the strategy	company
innovation and cutting edge technology to keep up with our competition	company
fully recognize vas products as key contributors to future [company] strategy and growth, build process and structure to support this.	company
atleast give 300 for the transportation because company give only 250 we pay 300  we need also back support  also give yearly bonus  two days off	company
in all departments on the end of month should be meeting and discus all issues and got new ideas and reduce problems and make improvement in all departments	company
future and strategic policies should be communicated with blue collar employees and they also should be aware of the changes and new direction where the organization is heading.	company
as-is environment/our measures let people in doubt if we are able to work in this industry (in a wealthy mannor) for the next 10+ years.	company
company-wide understanding / early planning of 2018 activity to start from jan with a clear plan	company
we need improvements in order to serve customers faster and more efficiently.	company
some of our processes seem dated and require a lot of manual work.	company
we are very fast in making short term decisions, but we lack a clear strategy.	company
extremely poor hardware for a company such as [company].	company
despite obvious progress, software development is still lagging far behind other industries.	company
[company] global forwarding is making the same mistake again like with the nfe project.	company
too fast and too radical change!!	company
1.employee should get the chance to learn each and every activity of the floor in physically and system also.	company
first of all thanks a lot for giving me chance to share my view.	company
but now in the 10 dirham no one can eat the food.so from my opinion is that company must increased something .	company
now we re using this one damaging in our foot and too much pain.	company
i would like the management to provide free transportation to all workers as other companies are trying to do it in order to make it a better company	company
equal respect and opportunity to each member.	company
so that we can survive in that particular situatio	company
improve system integration, make system more simplely and effectively.	company
need to hire more creative young talents, which is important for thurtre development,we need creation.	company
we have bloated organization, countless kam/tlm ,  higher input with lower outcome.	company
be doubt about product's strategic prediction.	company
we need a clear plan of action for our bussiness, and also have a plan and support to employee growth along with the company.	company
we need enhanced systems and connectivity.	company
understanding where the company is moving towards and being able to compete with our competitors.	company
the it connectivity and current premise	company
there is not much feedback.	company
there are some processes that would really benefit from automation.	company
but this would need an investment from intel (time and money)	company
desperate need of well-underbuilt it system with global scope, better focus on customers, less on kpi's, dashboards and admin for measurement purposes.	company
i would like to have a more defined strategy for the future within the company.	company
what ways can be taken in order to grow and promote.	company
we need to set goals, create short lines and act according to the strategy 2020.	company
on a global scale we need one vision / agreement	company
the power and responsibility to be an equal to do the things better.	company
management should see what employees are doing really with open mind & heart	company
the clients issues must be the first priority and the countries only look at their own issues.	company
certain internal cost structure bare the risk of kicking themselves out of the market because they are too expensive.	company
response from global colleagues needs to be improved.	company
it's definitely very important to have technological tools that support and optimize employees' work.	company
"a lot of technological development is missing and this makes us be ""behind"" our competitors."	company
new strategies for the further improvements in business	company
still we need better improvement our staff and we need dress code in the company	company
sales new business growth will simply not be enough to resolve fundamental cost issues	company
market strategy with good competition	company
closing issues which operations/cssv highlight which can not be resolved locally.	company
the company needs to review its asset investment policy and strategy in africa in order to compete this market.	company
closing offices / stations due to negative results in the past its not, in my opinion, the best way to deal with these negative results.	company
clear long term goals and associated actions towards it.	company
keep high focus on our strategic role and growth in the market as undisputed leaders in freight forwarding and for customers.	company
grading of employees and generalizing grades accross different divisions and assuming same set of technical expertise is applicable accross the same bandwidth needs to be improved.	company
we need to look at thing such as digitization and artificial intelligence as a very big opportunity, invest in them and tap their full potential.	company
they have tremendous advantages in terms of reducing cost, increasing speed of processes.	company
co shouldn't concern on petty expenses instead should challenge ourselves on the increasing market share.	company
many mistakes of the job holder  delay in the appointment for inspection	company
review of internal operational/customer and sales process to a leaner and efficient process.	company
increase ownership towards the staff by hearing what is constructive and recognize individual efforts.	company
as times goes by, i started to understand that everything goes around budget, even though we understand that some standard that [company] apply is very high, but due to budget, we can't achieve that standard.	company
improvement is ongoing and is only a matter of time to realize the goal.	company
we should work smarter, not harder!	company
as a group, [company] are very much aware of new developments in the industries we serve.	company
speed to react and/or participate in these new trends and developments needs improvement.	company
higher managements need to support lower level (warehouse) people more.	company
for the future the company should prepare a rigid strategy which will lead the employee for their well being and grow themselves within the company very well.	company
transparency in future decisions, future developments and if you are seen as career driven and have potential it should be offered openly.	company
too much emphasis on short term saving and not enough emphasis on building benefits.	company
time to implement strategy	company
its needed the consistent of thee strategy and direction	company
need to have good strategic	company
the performance management team need to understand and study further on the volume/complexity of operation process of specific station/product/customer/sector to ensure the performance evaluation done with truth and fair view.	company
should be clear to all levels what is expected to happened and what needs to be executed.	company
how to gain more biz	company
i believe in several facets of the company we are behind the times and out of date, the current logis system should have been replaced long ago, other companies have much better ways of doing things that are much more streamlined	company
more / better sales people  5.	company
unsure at this point, mostly all covered off and going forward	company
structure - to ask employies what should be better and not make a decision only on management area.	company
need to keep up with competition, have to quickly update our is system.	company
development of software and automation for specific use.	company
fte in line with work and development	company
it seems to lag rather than lead the industry	company
nothing, keep on tracking as we are with our current strategy of thinking and planning ahead - strategy 2020, fcg.	company
i have seen a lot of good thinks in this company.	company
i could not see negative points.	company
be open and transparent!	company
new airfreight system is be more flexible user friendly and accurateness airway billing to customer.	company
need to increase p & l ...[company] is not prompt in reacting to market forces...example agency / airlines fees.	company
1)we should have few contractors that only commit to [company] so they can really focus and listen to us.	company
best to put some [company] staff on the front line to get some control on the contractors movement.	company
2)security need to improve.	company
system still has drawbacks, of which some are dragging us down with the time taken to fix/go roundabout.	company
some colleagues are unable to keep up with the changes.	company
more internal promoting ensuring supervisors can completely understand and preform the duties required of those they supervise.	company
the process of d/o release by ocean freight is slower than others competitors.	company
warehouse extension to support cargo volume	company
more focus/connect/grow & successful in global market.	company
shipment will be exposed to the rain when rainy season come.	company
i think not to be improved but to be continue the good job of each [company] ph employee.	company
hq strategy changes some frequently	company
[company] stragety on domestic and iws product development	company
we want to know clear about company's target very year, as we want to take part in it and make effort on this as well.	company
since i was hired, i have seen the disastrously failed implementation of nfe, a severe drop in profitability, mass firings of center leadership, poorly orchestrated transitions to new software systems, and negligible raises in pay.all of this is bad.	company
we as company need to start improving our business acquisitions.	company
too many times have i personally seen accounts and bids won that result in more work with no gp to reflect our hard work.	company
communication from upper management on long term goals	company
also, not kept on mtw for all trainings, now processors are expected to keep yet another log.	company
to proceed in growing the business in each station to ensure the leadership of the logistics and freight forwarding world to be handled by [company] global forwarding	company
[company] has great global network and i feel the same is either not properly utilized or under utilized, if there would be more focus to further strengthen and improve the same and provide diversified & cost effective products would increase market share.	company
some people very negative and we need to improve positivity	company
the two step system does need a lot of improvement.	company
[company] leaders needs to improve the set-up in general regarding the profitshare.it's not okay that origin doesn't accept loss business even if there's profit at the locals etc.	company
this issue takes way too much time of ours!	company
as todays people rely on technology and not papers.	company
we need to adopt better working standards and compete with the best in the market with respect to facilities management.	company
we can improve with cost effective management, there is ample lot of cost saving which can be done thru various methodologies.	company
there are a lot of changes happening and coming in the future, job security and career planning is not clear.	company
there are lot of improvement, expecting the same to be continued.	company
changes are good and required to stay competitive however too many at the same time can be risky.	company
we need to consider differences from smaller and biger stations.	company
especially with new system coming.	company
smaller are mostly ad hoc markets and canât work the same way as big stations.	company
system needs to be flexible for all to use.	company
we need to modernize our business electronically and adapt to the growing digital culture with modern apps and technologies.	company
until now we were more kpi & cost driven at global level, in my opinion.	company
as everything is manual, we need some automation to reduce the time and energy wasted on jobs that could be done in seconds!	company
we are heavy in administration, check the checker type activities.	company
long term goals and the focus is too basic and although everyone can see their part, its not exciting nor motivating.	company
stop the practice of buying business with little or no revenue	company
giving more feedback to employees when there doing a good job.	company
more learning's about what freight forwarding is for those new to the industry.	company
the overall revenue performance of the business.	company
we need to more competitive in the market	company
back up plan whenever company facing a high staff tern over especially sale portion, it's made a company have obstacle.	company
simplify structure to have quicker communication	company
more openness when it comes to ofr and afr market trends and how competitors are able to secure sharper rates than [company]	company
quoteshop and matrix pricing is never competitive.	company
quotes need to be refined several times before they are worth submitting to a potential client.	company
cod client  often have  gst  customs duties more communication	company
increased opportunities for identified staff within the business.	company
listening to subject experts who have many years experience, it should not be seen as a negative or resistant to change.	company
continue to strive hard for successful of team and company as well.	company
lack of right focus and support to grow accounts, win new business	company
we need to be competitive in the market	company
even though lot of strategy decisions taken still there is a room for improvement.	company
according to future forecast we can take cohesive plan to grow further	company
my manager needs to take a rest and focus on work.	company
it is impossible to do double job even if she is able to manage	company
in competitive around business world, company must improve great and superb strategy, even in our company to achieve powerful and great aims	company
hope to the company do the best	company
message should channel too each and everyone in the company to align and work together towards one direction	company
i work, we are continually improving the quality of our products and services	company
more communication and update about the implementation and development of company strategy.	company
potential demand for creating the market	company
profitable business is the most important.	company
quick reaction to market situation	company
future and strategy	company
- target and direction  - future plan	company
to be prepare for new changes to market conditions	company
there is uncertainity, and while we know ebit and ebit conversion will be focus in the coming years, more communication and what would be executed will help.	company
we'd like to have more chances having freely talk with top management to know company's fututre strategy	company
we should stop trying to outsource jobs that shouldn't be outsourced, especially at the station level.	company
i think the new direction of the new ceo is clear and very important.	company
3 global ceo in 4 year together with many senior changes globally.	company
challenging to adapt their different way of doing business where is does not meet the reality in our daily life.	company
we do see clear strategy shared by ho.	company
hope our pace to launch new system or cutting-edge applications can be accelerate and enhance the power of it, don't be abandoned by the net-era.	company
global network: should be well organized with same goal -- 2020 strategy.	company
it always change.	company
[company] needs to improve the motivation to workers as a global company,we need to increase the opportunities to grow as a professionals, to have the opportunity to grow internally and internationally.	company
the engagement that [company] needs to handle customer needs and satisfaction.	company
other freight forwarders are so interested in customer needs	company
we are not a competitive in our industry.	company
our business model to get rates isent working properly.	company
less pass the buck & not my job games being played..	company
i believe we need to get our operational cost under control.	company
i understand our pricing strategy, but believe more emphasis should be placed in reducing internal cost/waste so we are able to provide more aggressive pricing.	company
more focus on long term business approach investing in our future vs cost cutting that affects our ability to the level of service we commit to our customers.	company
too many obstacles to adequately staff/run our business.	company
every decision made feels like it's done by those who know nothing about basic air freight.	company
we need more freight	company
being a it student, moving towards project management, and holding a innovative head, means i am looking for innovation.	company
process, quality, future awareness and new strategy.	company
unfortunately, there is no research on that.	company
ops should approve before sales can confirm to customer	company
i work virtually and i often am not updated about personnel changes at the station that i report to.	company
i think the pressure to get immediate financial improvement in my country is driving a senior management to be reactionary instead of strategic.	company
we lack focus.	company
as the world's largest forwarder, it is frustrating that smaller forwarders have access to more aggressive pricing & capacity ( especially fcl ocean).	company
stability and transparency:  employees don't know if they are coming or going right now	company
new reporting systems need to be implemented sooner	company
so in my point of view try to make the employees happy by giving their need if he/she is capable.	company
our future depends on what the leadership is doing today.	company
are employees with skills given opportunity?	company
the future is open.	company
office timings should be strictly followed.	company
[company] is amazing, best freight forwarding.	company
constant changes in the way kpis are measured, which are not clear and are not related to the daily work of each workplace, the impossibility to have career growth in the company, the instability and downfall regarding the company's future.	company
promoting existing staff rather than seeking outside replacements	company
we should try to be more felxible, be more for different cargo handling !	company
to continue to communicate to improve awareness of the future plans.	company
in our division, we need 1 more person, but nothing has been done to solve this problem.	company
we do not win any significant new business	company
we haven't in import or export sea won any major customers in 2017.	company
focus and priorities are changing too often and this is not giving the right and needed continuity to our efforts.	company
too many changes are demotivating our people and create a sense of uncertainty.	company
problems with dutch customs that their systems during maintance doesn't work	company
just only paper future strategy topics, no clear vision from smt and md	company
love to put them on first place but i need support	company
do business smarter and more efficiently...	company
we have the necessary equipment and resources to work.	company
allow to grow professionally in the company.	company
so we can plan ahead with strategy	company
in my opinion, there should not be a sudden and frequent changes on the process as such creates confusion on the employees and operational execution as well.	company
it should be improved the  strategic level thinking for competing in the market.	company
it is understandable being in the logistic industry is more challenging and competitive.	company
but company should think in more strategically	company
some systems are outdated but we're on the good track to renew them and innovate	company
always growth + profit.	company
cant always be both in equal priority	company
need to go back to basics - sometimes too much discussion about long term and no short term fix - give local entities more independence on decision	company
company's policies are changing frequently without consistency which makes most of staff are hardly adapted it.	company
future strategy should be achieved with new venture.	company
operationally, we are not versatile enough to adopt to new market requriements	company
rather than a country wise single policy, it would be better if company develops zone wise strategy, because different indian zones have different market scenario.	company
please provide advance & latest systems to employees / need some improvements on sales tools (i-sell) / need for advanced & analytical sales reports / more automated reports instead of manual reports / need more advanced trainings for employees.	company
we should make a new strategy to get more business from the market.	company
no development or innovation for operations and warehouse's nature.	company
to be honest, we need to improve our it systems related to our activities in order to be more competitive and set an example in the market, since we are the market leaders.	company
customer has developed strategy of air exports consoles which gives more profits	company
the power and responsibility to be an equal to fulfill the work	company
more sales on getting new business	company
we have to retain our existing customer and have to bring new business to develope our company	company
differential prices needs to be undertaken based on industry and type of customer.	company
user friendly software, current software like qs and isell aren't really user friendly.	company
need to be improve much more profitable in clearance also.	company
need to  give training for present trends to adopt in day to day  work (e.g, excel,office).	company
i think the strategy with the competition.	company
give employee the promotion opportunity	company
our ofr rate purchasing strategy at all levels needs to be improved urgently.	company
so may poor decisions have been made with nfe and the way we move cargo.	company
"it department - most poor service, not ""user friendly"" platform set-up , lace of professionalism, not understanding the business and the user needs."	company
technology - too many separated tools not in sync one to another portraying the wrong picture	company
lack of freight.	company
we need more business!	company
we need to go back to using the gateways as the main port of entry and departure which will increase the volume and reduce the overall cost.	company
focus on gaining new business, no cost cutting on a finacially stable and profitable divison (isc) of [company].	company
long term strategy and decisions, beyond monthly results	company
a strategy that allows to think more on the long term and not month by month.	company
at the company's general level we have failures in processes due to too many structural changes which happened very close to each other, with a lack of vision towards the future, this impacts the service we provide.	company
leadership with an open door policy is required, who makes use of his/her time in company issues and not on social networks.	company
"we need to continue to evolve if we want to be classified as "" top tier provider "" we need to  have a clear understanding on  the reason on some of the business we lose """	company
focus on the short term goals to achieve long term goals.	company
the level of real-time visibility we offer our clients on their shipments, big vs.small, local vs.	company
career development structure needs to be improved, as doesn't matter for how long you are in the company, or skills and talents should be counted in order to get promoted.	company
growing within the company	company
i have been on a travel ban for 4 of the 10 months i have been employed.	company
this is effecting my ability to grow my current book of business and next year it will be very difficult building a pipeline which i should be working on now.	company
more ijps & strategy towards work should be initiated so that people working for long years get the opportunities to get hired for higher designations.	company
the operations team is not motivated to bring on additional business, it is just seen as more work.	company
lack of motivation to help secure new business.	company
we need to keep stressing the basics of freight forwarding, pick ups on time, moving freight, communicating to customers.	company
better communication of the country strategy to increase business allowing additional management opportunities	company
we understand that the fms life expectancy is done but where we are headed is still up in the air.	company
i understand that the afr & ofr products are much bigger and require a quicker action	company
i think there has been improvements overall.	company
for more than 3 years with nfe etc and orga we killed the spirit and motivation big time.	company
we also keep changing management quite often in specific countries.	company
consistent message from upper management on air export handling process.	company
too many management changes, too many organizational structural changes, too many brms, too much doubt.	company
objectives and goals seem one dimensional and senior leadership seem to not understand what the reality actually is in the field.	company
pricing should be more competitive and based on local market conditions.	company
we also need true sales support.	company
current sales support is leadership-facing.	company
in the business development process, there is less consistency in pricing, less competitive and entrepreneurial pricing solutions.	company
we sort of know the issues, but either don't act at all to fix them or act too drastically by hiking rates so high that we cannot win business.	company
using more technology in the field for customers.	company
such as apps that allow for pickup updates, and essentially to bring the company to 2017, when we are still operating like its 1995, and we don't have these tools out there to support us.	company
for future, need to train employees in suitable way and plan their strategy like role of work for more work productivity from them.	company
future strategy need to improve.	company
senior leaders needs to be changed every 2-3 years and needs to be given a new team to handle and not the same old process every year ,so that they can focus on the process more!	company
there should be proper planning incase of contingencies or natural disasters.	company
grooming the executives for there future development.	company
speed of computer systems which can be slow at times.	company
all [company] companies to be branded with proper signage on all companies/offices/warehouses etc., indicating to clients/general public services provided including contact information.	company
we really need to rethink about our objectives and convert them into short and long term goals in order to be more effective.	company
we need to improved for the invoices to be paid on the time.	company
we need to get all the invoices process, scan and ready  for the payments.	company
get good statements, making sure there is no past due invoices.	company
communication with senior, no feedback, no help...	company
fte is a way to measure which can't apply to some important customers due to the extra none tangible work required for such business.	company
global strategy sometimes not really adapted to our ground and local reality.	company
our head region should be more concerned about what is really happening in our countries or market to fit better the strategy	company
i am afraid in my opinion there is no spirited effort towards this direction.	company
what is being done- finance who steal company money.customer service insulting coutry m who left-in front of everyone.	company
we should try to understand our clients needs and help to appreciate their concerns	company
the sales department to bring in customers and reduce smts	company
for the future the company should prepare a rigid strategy  which well lead employee for their well begin and grow  themselves within the company very well.	company
missing strategies & plans on improving or target new markets	company
it becomes very difficult for us to understand the strategy of the group , mostly towards ssa countries looking at all the entities closing down.	company
looks like closing down is the easiest solution chosen as soon as issues raise up	company
speed at which we move, need to be faster.	company
[company] strategic partners from carriers,  stronger products and more competitive position in market to secure more business.	company
our credit terms is an obstacle compared to market key players	company
right and sufficient work force in sales for the long term growth is required .	company
depositing!as i don't see any improvement from last year.	company
"that timing in our company, need to be ""up to date""."	company
future expansions of the business.	company
local strategy to be aligned with global [company] strategy.	company
i think it doesn't improve our chances to get new customers attention - i refer to small businesses only, not to global customers who knows [company] well	company
i cant understand the future strategy of the company.for me it is rather vague	company
new business acquisition & retention of existing business.	company
one strategy and goal for the year for the whole organization from the global office all the way to every country.	company
quarterly townhall should be carried out to provide update on result and future strategy to all [company] india employees	company
ocean export commercials need to be at par with competition.	company
most of the times local forwarders have better buy from shipping lines than what we have.	company
need volume based refund policy with 2-3 shipping lines for penetrating more in ocean export.	company
think globally, act locally needs to be looked into within the framework	company
effective selling , treating employees just as numbers - find other options to save cost/improve profitability.	company
decisions on improving system requirement and it infrastructure is utmost priority.	company
lot's of things strategy where company is going	company
every minute counts	company
we need more frieght in our building	company
we need more cargo	company
lack of one set solution to simple problems.	company
it needs to be one correct way to address problems that every supervisor follows.	company
the depot we work at is far too small , drivers under constant pressure, not enough staff , company run on a shoe string to improve profit, job getting worse	company
i think the one thing [company] has lagged behind on is systems, but this is being taken care of with our new system on the way, excited to see where that can take us as a company.	company
separate business unites need to align together commercial & ops ) while gaining / retaining business along with strategies	company
station sales and profit	company
overly aggressive budgets have been set to make employees feel that their best efforts are not enough in the current environment.	company
more realistic budgets, and the bare minimum of operating profitably as a station and country need to be first priority.	company
actions launched by product team has a conflict with sales kpi set in 2017.	company
clear and consistent vision for development.	company
continue to improve our business strategy and communication to the employees.	company
in order sustain in the industry and market, restructure is required.	company
[company]'s it systems are not always up to industry standards.	company
i know that there is a new system being implemented over the next 1-2 years and hopefully, that will move us forward in this regard.	company
i would like for us to embrace technology more efficiently as we lag behind on our base logis system which causes so much data entry.	company
also we print to much paper, need to find a way to not have to print so much paper and effectively waste it.	company
stabilization  remaining focused on core objectives and priorities.	company
synergy between industrial projects and [company], especially in iah/iap.	company
we have a lot of missing opportunities.	company
order supplies timely so we are not w/o items to complete our job.	company
leading the company out of crisis	company
we had make change in top managements and left the n-user on the side.	company
no central support, no tech development, seem to be very stagnant just staying afloat hoping cargowise is successful	company
there are still some questions regarding responsibilities but i do believe it is being ironed out.	company
it systems across the board	company
need to be more aggressive in seeking new business.	company
we have the relevant resources in place to take on additional business in order to meet our long term goals.	company
current product structure is good and back to industry standard vs old nfe and other structures.	company
stability will continue to bring efficiency, expertise and better quality.	company
as always, thru shipment visibility is key for our future.	company
this has been on our top priority list for years now.	company
we need the tools upgraded, at a quicker pace.	company
before you demand you must prove it to us that you can do it,	company
how to make the job more efficient	company
it renewal must be put forth asap as we lag behind competition in regards to reporting capabilities and flow of information to the clients	company
too much attention to kpi which reduces ops productivity.	company
ops are dumped with extra tasks besides their main job duties and experiencing not having enough time to process shipments which leads to low customer satisfaction.	company
company itself is taking initiatives which are good and beneficial for the employees on regular basis.	company
as per market conditions,increament should be more.	company
the future goals should be idealized for new and varied work and effective strategies should be made to accomplish it by everyone	company
needs to make future planning if natural calamity comes.	company
alignment within the overall organization to focus on the products best delivered by each unit.	company
i'd like to experience a better cross-divisions alignment about products and services we offer to our customers and possibly more internal share of our network,albeit i reckon that the last 2 years the group has walked towards the right direction	company
we carry burdeon that we are too large for some medium sized customer	company
while this unit is forward thinking and has a good vision of where the industry is going and where we need to be to meet the challenges, the rest of the company is lagging behind and hindering any progress we can make.	company
unfortunately, you don't always have the data quality needed for certain analyses (various sources), and many data still need to be gathered up with difficulty.	company
we have to work easier and simpler.	company
the workplace should not be something that people dread every day.	company
centralize pricing to improve steering of volume to core carriers; it affects our procurement  for example: latin america pcm may not approach core carriers as not aware of their product and prefer to use one carrier ignoring rpcm guidance	company
this is first time i saw the 2 types of employees in one company	company
need clarity on actual bookings placed.	company
speed up full usage, implementation of seawin & cargo wise.	company

last year, we had an awareness session on problems of communication relying on e-mail, but because it is something that cannot be changed at once, it is necessary to continue considering and implementing some countermeasures.	company
a better comunication between the board adn the rest of the company.	company
their feedback is very important.	company
communication needs to be improve to be able to hear other opinions, suggestion and ideas	company
inter departmental communication could be improved further overall and people need to be reminded that they are working as part of a team on overlapping applications and should share data to ensure changes can be linked.	company
other departments or teams are not as willing to work together with us to resolve issues.	company
during a recent system enhancement, at least 2 of the other teams involved offered little to no help to identify and resolve defects.	company
support and sharing opportunities that should be improve/develop employee capability.	company
there is so much influence of dotted line reporting head.	company
however, this gentleman is not being judged in this eos.	company
too much passing the buck, not within my job scope thinking, lack of assuming ownership.	company
interaction is not bad now but could be better.	company
cooperation between the products, issues to one should be just as important as issue to another.	company
"we all work for the same company, i hear too many times "" we have bigger issues to address""."	company
my issues are normally overlooked until becomes major issue	company
we can all improve on all aspects of the job	company
i am currently happy with everything.	company
we have improved already in my opinion	company
lack of entrepernerial spirit and general lack of team ethic.	company
team is divided and filled with negativity caused by some individuals.	company
certain team members receive more help than others consistently which is unfair.	company
sometimes llp is perceived incorrectly or not fully understood by other products.	company
there seems to be a cultural divide that in spite of repeated attempts by sec/or (globally) to interface with business concerns, conflicting priorities tend to cause others to distance themselves from us.	company
the improvment and the fear of changement	company
in order to work with quality, we need motivate employee.	company
we still need to address work balance issues amongst our team but there has been definite improvement	company
daily shipment turnover, late shipments causing bottle necks in ops and warehouse.	company
the company is very segmented, in that each department seems to only work for their own interests instead of working as one company in a team.	company
collaboration between business development & product needs to improve.	company
we need a more collaborative approach than experienced at present.	company
data quality needs to improve to be reliable.	company
working in projects we have to move air, road, rail and sea shipments.	company
given the size of our company is sometimes hard to find the best person to speak to within a certain field - perhaps better internal networking would help, we are looking at this.	company
the guiding principle of all decisions should be solely the success of the company, and not the political aspirations of some individuals.	company
- communication between teams  - workload  - insufficient people to do the volume of work required  - spend some money on the finance system - it's so old it's an embarrassment!	company
trust between it and business units.	company
collaboration between regional and global teams	company
some of the senior mgt are not willing to listen to the employee feedback.	company
senior mgt blames employee outwardly etc before asking for actual cause of a service issue	company
i think qcc needs to improve with inter-departmental communication with cs.	company
this has always been a continuing issue, and needs to take focus now.	company
if we centralize the trucking department i hope i would be more fruitful for the company	company
we advertise a lot about importance of teamwork and how this can make the difference, but on a daily basis we don't always seem to put all that into practice among all stakeholders / business units and end up working in silos sometimes.	company
supervoicer is good but his way is not correct.floor staf are not happy about that .	company
atlest we need a improvemnt in this facility evrey small isue they are making big .they are not monitering our prodectiviti.	company
improve the team work instead reporting direct supervisor..to many guys here are they want to promote thats why the people are making fight.	company
team work should need to be stronger than before  and communication also need to be improved fic shows partiality to some staff that's need to be stopped and some staff also hesitate to do the hard work that we do that also need stopped	company
lsh shortage of space causes lots of multiple mhe traffic operating same time at cramped space that may result to safety risks&/or product damages.	company

customer penalty draft must be received on time for timely clearance	company
a great cross departmental team work is essential to tap potentials and also in terms of knowledge sharing in order to achieve a specific goal	company
we need to more focus on coordination between team to deliver business on time.	company
working together is an important role in each organization because of which we can easily face new challenges and bring out in better results.	company
having a quarterly call additionally within each region, presented by the rd and rsm, stating what is working well, what success/ challenges we have, highlighting star individuals to motivate at branch level by rewarding them more.	company
a person does not feel good putting 100 percent of their part if the counter part 70%	company
improve communication between the [company] stations  find a solution for the profit sharing issue	company
atmosphere in company is very tense due to some disrespectful/rude behavior/treatment and strong resistance to listen to employees.	company
this negatively affects mood/motivation of employees, ultimately team performance.	company
often times i feel that we internally are our worst enemy- our processes and procedures are great, but sometimes hinder us from success!	company
i find myself doing a lot of back and forth with [company] offices about petty things that end up affecting profitabil	company
more communication with all employees of each company getting in consideration that sometime, none of all them have access to information received	company
team has been improved far more better than before and so is their productivity.	company
process alignment is in progress and has seen good change already.	company
get arrange more encourages and salary review	company
the expectations of a single employee ,rather the focus of the team as a whole.	company
under pricing services and not providing necessary resources	company
too many priorities at a time.	company
we need the opportunity to be successful at every task.	company
we are always trying to improve.	company
hope to see improvement on this area.	company
logistics and freight forwarding is an exceptionally teamwork industry.	company
is something strong nowadays but should be reinforced continuously to obtain the best result every day.	company
the selection process and the possitive leadership of the supervizors showing the equity	company
- to lead/motivate team to get better results	company
majority other managers on the team and within the facility lack critical mgmt.	company
employees w/in team do not conduct themselves w/ professional conduct or show respect for peers.	company
more respect for one another.	company
we work brilliantly within our respective teams however we must further increase our drive towards promoting cross teamwork to be able to benefit from our internal strengths and competencies present.	company
explore synergies and work to a mutual advantage locally.	company
hope the new it system (cw1) would be much better than current system, not complicated & user friendly system which could benefit to all user/[company] staff	company
our team is best team, our team is supporting each other, specially  our management team supporting and gratitude on our team.any changing job we are always succeeding the job.	company
if you give us 100% we will give you 110% because we feel valued and appreciated.	company
at the end everyoneâs value needs to be counted.	company
since we are working in [company], we know team work is our strength.	company
they have become very comfortable in their positions and fail their direct reports regularly.	company
origin teams need to be better briefed on the correct procedures for sending pre-alerts.	company
we frequently have storage and demurrage charges accrue due to pre-alerts being sent to the wrong email inbox.	company
constant moving and rearranging.	company
systems/software speed needs improvement.	company
he principal notes to report to more youth	company
overruling, over use of escalation, ignore responsibility are usually found both in and cross functions.	company
manager is stupid , no long term vision , company is look like political crisis	company
need to make more contribution to remain same dierction.	company
continue training for the staff, give them time to share each ideas and respect each other.	company
staffing is still a biggest issues within the company as there's business on board but do not have resources.	company
continuing to have an open-door policy on sharing ideas when working as a team.	company
although the most the team do work well together there is still room for more improvement.	company
stelle the resource problem	company
taking care for solve the problem	company
continuous team work and respect for one another.	company
success and what its really like.	company
we are not necessarily getting documentation or follow-up related communication in a timely manor.	company
and processing time is slow.	company
get the file done correctly in a timely manner so the customer is happy.	company
in turn this will make the company profitable.	company
supervisors should be encouraged to stand by the ideas promoted in cif training that all employeess regardless of length with the company have valuable opinions, and that their ideas count.	company
"on my team as a ""newbie"" i am often ignored."	company
we need to continue communicating with each other	company
there is a bad concept within the company to pass the buck.	company
taking ownership of a problem / matter (cross department) lacks.	company
we need to understand the importance of team work.	company
email is far better and quicker	company
cooperation and understanding with other business sectors and the freight forwarder mentality regarding customs issues  in that if it's a customs issue it's automatically a brokerage issue and not ai or oi sending bad information that caused an issue	company
involvement of [company] in active process improvements and gemba  involvement of it to suggest process improvements based on new tech available.	company
rather than sticking to the hierarchal matrix of problem solving, it would be more efficient and quick if steps are taken directly to solve the problem irrespective of post/position.	company
since customers consider danzas as one big family (all products under one roof), its expected that all the family members (different departments)need to operate in sync with each other and that is not at 100% at the moment.	company
quality of communication among colleagues is lousy, lacks respect and amiability.	company
my direct team leader does not show support or encourages growth and abuses their power within the department	company
team works a cross all levels, [company] is one company and we should work together and use each of us skills to be the best company on the market.	company
i find that sometimes we are fighting a losing battle in our team.	company
when we had our cif training earlier this year i mentioned that our company needs to work as one team to make our company more successful.	company
more learning around terms and quoting	company
whenever there is staff change, customer requirement or process change, i believe everyone involving to work for this customer should be notified; and we need to review the current work flow as a team to check whether the current procedure can adapt.	company
more cross departmental and company social events are required in order to foster a stronger work ethic and culture between departments, this will ultimately lead to more employees contributing and supporting the company to reach its strategic goals.	company
maturity & respect at times is still lacking in my team.	company
is in dire need of improvement.	company
ensuring quotes and/or agreed quotes are loaded and noted in millman before passing over for billing so invoices can be billed correctly the first time to avoid unnecessary credits & rebills being raised.	company
need to improve in team back	company
and more important is to treat every shipment as our own.	company
interdepartmental coordination is working well but still there is a room for improvement.	company
everybody is a vital part of the company, thus, everyone should be able to do it right the first time to prevent any delays or irregularities that may affect our customers.	company
for pricing, we are always not competitive from the 1st quote, for ops, always revert with lack of manpower, thus, cherry picking on what to do and what not to do, at the end, sales do it.	company
support from various departments  competitive pricing from products afr/ofr	company
the company direction is good but not everyone understand the situation and what is necessary need to be done in order to achieve the goal.	company
it will good to have more resting time during office hour in order to distress the work pressure,, may can help to bring up work performance,, quality and motivation,,,	company
lack of team support from other department to resolve customer issues on time.	company
ops team support required to input cost accrual(no ces ws items) & resolve carrier disputes promptly to reduce rework to fico/hp team	company
as until now, it seem there is a gap between every division.	company
i think as employee, we need a time to refreshing our mind by planning event family gathering, therefore employee's spirit will up again and also this event will make us as a solid teamwork.	company
responsible, speak by data	company
inter-department collaboration needs to improve	company
we are kul gateway staff working 24/7 days and process a lot of gateway shipment.	company
teamwork culture need to reinforce as individual department still silo in their own team kpi and result without having a big picture thinking in mind.	company
all the people manager need to lead by example.	company
too complicated dept structure and procedure, simplify the procedure will improve efficiency.	company
"(e.g billing flow, each dept is claiming this is not their task etc, we need a ""billing department"" to centralize."	company
lack unnecessary reduplicate department, our process is very multiple go through many level management, there is inefficient	company
(2) more it solutions on logistic's data management to save the human resources.	company
suggest more cross-department team building activities so everyone can understand the company well and serve customer in a better way.	company
1, not clear working scope of every department.	company
2, struggle on internal communication and cause delay and customer unsatisfaction.	company
what needs to be improve is the team work.	company
each area of the company works as an independent island.	company
whse performance and quality of information.	company
the warehouse and it's staff have little regard for accuracy and urgency in my opinion.	company
they dismiss the office out of hand and show little if any real respect for what we are trying to do.	company
very little team work to resolve issues.	company
listening to the desk level employees and take into consideration there ideas of improving the process.	company
focus on solving rather than explaining a situation	company
we need to standardize our procedure better.	company
there is too many layers involved in moving a shipment.	company
sales, agents, rates, trade lane, implementation, mangers, other offices.	company
nobody is on the same page.	company
the amount of privacy on issues where there is a problem with one employee.	company
there needs to be a level of comfort and amicability within an office in order to create a happier work atmosphere, thus better work performance.	company
things need to be standardised more... if one station is using order of recipet to determine when shipments are cleared, and another is using the eta provided by the customers, it leads to confusion on the customers part.	company
the entire team needs to be on the same page.	company
some coworkers only do as they feel would benefit them, but will not do the work when a new idea is purposed.	company
although it is good for the employee, its bad for business.	company
customer svc needs to be more reliable; pricing needs to be more competitive in market; to collaborate more in comml & not so many people in the same market to many people tl, kam, fs, mnc, csi - we should work together not against one another	company
phx station manager's way he communicates and treats his 2 local sales reps.	company
correct billing.	company
fixing issues in a timely manner.	company
the bid teams need to respect and work along side new branches.the branch managers are aware of carriers locally & whom can be competitive.	company
everything's too segmented but there's no ownership, so everything can be easily put on hold and when customer comes for clarification, no one holds the responsibility.	company
well when it comes to company as one it not like that.	company
when reaching out for help from other ports you can cannot get the help from other ports.	company
communication of changes or small improvements in the different processes, sometimes a boss only tells one person and not the entire team, when this information is not communicated, it causes other people in the team to make mistakes.	company
i think we could work more in a team, we could better communicate with each other and solve the problems together.	company
more staff and family interaction ie, bbqs etc	company
better cooperation between regions, be one network	company
cooperation between origins, especially france where origins like le havre can be difficult to work with.	company
only assist when issue rise.	company
our internal stakeholders (especially product) and our global network partners should realize that ours is a network business and that we are interdependent on each other.	company
transparency and honesty saves a whole load of unnecessary efforts and time	company
need to improve team work.	company
we cannot shift work out that is currently been done and yet still keep resources.	company
managers, team leads and leaders should continue preaching that everyone can value add, every cent counts, promoting team work and a common goal	company
inter departmental unity has to improve a lot  not fast at taking corrective action on issues and not learning from them	company
need shear the experience for the new employees,	company
manager had limited our options for additional work leaving us short of work on occasion	company
departments need to be able to work much better together, there seems to be a department vs department mentality.	company
also it is drummed into employees to follow processes yet at high level it seems processes are followed to suit.	company
"issues with teamwork although there have been some improvements since the roll out of cif, some areas still continue to have the  mentality of  :not my problem"" "" not my job"" attitude."	company
it seems to me that team work needs to be improved so that we can solve problems easily.	company
to change the mindset to improve quality.	company
each department in the company should be acting as a team instead of separated company that looks after their own income to survive	company
we need to continue working as a bigger team instead of various teams in a single company with a single objective.	company
we need to continue to respect one another as i have seen it has improved but could do with further improvement.	company
fast response to emails are based on job tittle of the sender not the email content.	company
open discussion and approachable	company
we have to improve more cordination team	company
every internal department should also work as a teamwork, so that we can satisfy our customer in every manner.	company
eliminate the handovers for each department	company
if we are to get the best customer experience we need to act and speak one language and take responsibility of things and work we do.	company
team work to be improved	company
thinking global as a network and not protect countries interests	company
we are the hands on workers that know and understand not only what needs to be done, but how it needs to be done.	company
new import process not working and is similar to nfe model that did not work..upgrade logis air.	company
what needs to be improved is the acceptance of different opinions.	company
communication between business development, solutions design, account development and operations needs to improve.	company
if the communication between these groups was consistent and often, the customer and the teams would benefit drastically.	company
there is still a disconnect to all teams especially for those that are within a specialised role	company
the backing up within the export group needs to improve.	company
freight rates should be done from loading port and accurate.	company
all leaders must demonstrate their commitment to our four values, continue to drive results while following our guiding principle.	company
must walk the talk, increase the amount of feedback given to direct reports and focus on results focused behaviors.	company
at times it feels like the company is working against each other as if we are all in a competition against each other.	company
top down alignment of initiatives across all products.	company
getting better, but need to continue on this path.	company
also there are rivalry between the departments that obstructs the clear work of the company.	company
going well no need to change	company
if a problem occurs, no action is taken.	company
work efficiency.	company
the transportation need to be improved.	company
to improve team work we need better coordinations	company
to improve team work	company
appreciation should receive to all members who contribute best.	company
it seems like every man for themselves most of the time.	company
demanding performance in the eu and aspa for the cssv we were proud in giving.	company
all departments to be focused on the service, sales as well as assisting finance department regarding documentation sent to clients on time and sorting out queries immediately in order to cut down on our bad debt.	company
there is room for improvement within the sales regarding communications and team building to suit each individual.	company
this needs to change if we need to meet our 2020 strategy.	company
take care of learners and update them about changes the will be happening inside the company don't wait for last minutes to update them	company
teamwork needs improvement when it comes to cross-boarders relations.we need to have a global team turned to the same direction, respecting and considering each others.in some cases i find difficulty to have this from our colleagues around the world.	company
"many customers view us as ""one [company]"" already, and we need to harness our individual strengths to grow."	company
put aside personal problems to be able to give better things to colleagues and the work area, this with the aim of improving the quality and work environment.	company
team work should be improved.	company
we need to impriove on our internal processes	company
everything need to be improved	company
for me in our air port team nothing to improve.	company
we will try continue the same way.	company
people are just coming to do their job and leave without any drive to move things forward.	company
we must understand what they want & act accordingly.	company
few persons are showing sometimes a real weakness in working as a team	company
team work should improve	company
improvement needed of the connection between the sales team and operations+customer servise teams, we are facing some difficulties between the understanding of logistics process and the promissess that are made for customers (transit time/custom/ect)	company
big changes has occured on the location, so the seniormanagement needs to focus on getting the teams to get closer again and motivate to create a great workplace.	company
nothing need to improved	company
more x-functional team bulging activities required as we are one team not number of functions	company
x-functional communication & team work (global, regional and local)	company
work style need to be improved, all are working for their respective departments not for ultimate company goals which is the major issue.	company
i strongly feel teamwork has to improve and its success key of development of any department	company
i look forward to continuous improvement on teamwork	company
staff in the administration, they constantly winge and whine when new business is taken on,  they are luck to have a job and work for such a good company and have a great management team over them, we are not here for fun we are here to work not play	company
what need to be improve is the haz.	company
communication is still extremely poor across all section of the business we still spend the majority of our time chasing people trying to get the correct information we require to carry out our function within the business.	company
leaving unfinished processes.	company
"agree with [name], ceo, ""in the past months i have sometimes had the feeling that in certain parts of our organization there is a need for a stronger guidance on how a freight forwarding organization should work together."""	company
however,it is often difficult to get response w/o escalating an email.	company
as a small office, it seems we're not a priority	company
too many rate cards and lack of proper instructions from overseas.	company
sometimes we are not consulted in decisions that will negatively affect our commitments to our existing customers.	company
[name] is the best!	company
we struggle to get basic freight forwarding assistance from other offices.	company
i would say from being on the front line of receiving many of the calls is that we need to follow up with the customer's once receiving payment of their shipment and knowing that the freight is at the warehouse contacting the customer upon releasing	company
more team work needs to be improve	company
need to enhance team builiding in each team	company
need to helping us and share your good idea for your team for the better work for this company.	company
need cross utilization in order to meet tat.	company
without this the business will not work at all	company
reduce the time for responding to our requests for bookings or rfq's.	company
on process of aligning equal piece of work	company
other offices supporting the borders as everything gets dumped here	company
try to be good listener in teams, taking the time to understand everyone's ideas, and making sure everyone's suggestions are discussed.	company
processes are not executed in a coordinated and harmonized way.	company
we need to improve in that department..	company
gossiping staff creating a bad working atmosphere.	company
the whole infrastructure	company
on occasion i feel that as a team we are not all focused on seeing the bigger picture if everyone isn't 100% committed it makes it that much more difficult for those who are passionate about driving the company forward	company
network - need to work better together  more autonomy at country level to manage things like resource needs.	company
deliver what we say we are going to deliver	company
lack of effort/motivation by our us colleagues to address service issue.	company
the it supply/demand model often reaches its limits and becomes inefficient.	company
revision on the internal job posting; which cause ripple effect on the operations.	company
the company can only offer a better service if the effects are trained, to overcome the daily challenges that day deal with	company
more opportunity of training	company
i would like to see the following:  focus on bring on more profitable businesses rather than just volume.	company
sale group need learn how to identify/qualify the right/target customer rather than just rate.	company
more development opportunity for first-line staff.	company
cross department experience and information sharing	company
i think at an operational level the trainings should be more organized among all employees to make them operational process smoother.	company
if new and senior employees uses the tools and follow export compliance we will have less errors.	company
structure in department are not followed in order to comply to meet the job expectations .	company
recognition for new skill learned could be rewarded in our pay - per module rewards.	company
good people are leaving the company, and seldom something is done against it, and good people are not being supported to move and to develop further.	company
really need to take care of staff development in term of training if business situation do improve.	company
there's probably too much focus on productivity.	company
what lesson learnt.	company
still seems that learning and development is not a priority with the roll out cw1 and related tms applications.	company
with this, the company should focus on how to bridge the gap bet generations in order to build coherence.	company
learning and development plans would be a good option to improve our potentials and give an even better service to our customers.	company
in 10 years with [company] my career has included time with dsc and [company], i have been provided with absolutely zero yes zero opportunities for professional development.	company
i feel disconnected from really understanding the company vision.	company
i could not tell you which way my employer will go to in the future with for example driverless trucks, 3d printers, robotics (not macros to run steps, real robots)	company
training- one trainer for dispatch and one for cs	company
no pressure,no personal matter ,fic's are rude to explain things.	company
hands on training for wha in system like sap,exceed,highjump.	company
some employees need to learn the standard working instructions so that they can also be flexible and not just focus on the physical work like offloading.	company
provide more training opportunity	company
more idp plan should be applied	company
encourge personal development all the time , especially for the front-line stuff.	company
support on s21 system - local knowledge of system is limited and held by one or two people - i think it would be really helpful to have training sessions on the system (maybe saved in mynet)to run different reports, extract data and so on.	company
systems could be improved - or provide training on how to generate reports from the finance system	company
10 years those opportunities have completely dried up.	company
gaining access to systems can be slow this can hold back training and development	company
there needs to be a progression plan in place so employees who want to grow within the company have the opportunity to do so.	company
no investment in technology, even basic computers, that allow us to work properly.	company
no investment in learning/development, especially not anything that would be useful in an employee's future career inside/outside [company].	company
continuously update and share new information.	company
to be more accurate and to be more productive when it comes to work.	company
sharing also suggestions in the team for us to make a good solutions in any case of problem situation.	company
need to improvements in the area of communication and soft skills where each employee feels confident while facing customer and showing a confident and professional attitude.	company
we are compromising company growth because of taking things (like trainings) for granted.	company
( [company] lifeconex )i do live monitoring of perishable shipments, life science products etc.as per me we should get a practical knowledge about packaging of shipment,detail training of documentation, active containers set up, basic in warehousing.....et	company
my technical knowledge regarding automation in excel	company
office based training on the systems we use are all good though.	company
they should know about customs procedure properly.	company
need more focus and proper setups for further improvements on learning and developments of the employees	company
[company] [company] provides me with the opportunity for learning and development	company
company to provide more training/seminar for employee's continuous improvement	company
skills through all employees, within the organization.	company
i suggest las be given laptops to ease communication.	company
[company] tends to postpone certain topics on a regular basis.	company
regarding learning and development i still see issues with communication,possible involvment and time management.these areas could be improved further.	company
this needs to change.	company
to be more knowledgeable, we need training and understanding the full step of the operation whether in air or sea for us to understand more on the flow.	company
we need to focus on training	company
we need to be more pro-active than reactive when we grow our teams.	company
people who are working within the same position, needs to forward, to motivate them.	company
each staff should have a room for improvement.	company
if can create more opportunity to promote and improvement for staff	company
on going and continues each day changes and development to achieve the best results for our customers and for [company].	company
you are thrown to the wolves and learn by making mistakes.	company
too easy to make errors & are punished for an error that can be prevented.	company
it's unfair that this company loves to promote growth and development but yet there is none.	company
for someone like myself, i've been here for 4yrs and i developed myself from an ep who was use to doing the basic files to complex but not paid as such.	company
the promotion process needs work.	company
an awareness as how the system works overall.	company
afr) and how it flows through different softwares and finally dumped into crest/forwin or any software.	company
need to had more to jumpstart program for employees	company
1.suggest to have weekly email and folder of listings on learning, opportunities, etc.  2.	company
the company provides limited learning opportunities and on-job-training for workers at the operation line.	company
we need to improve in personal development	company
we have a lot of passionate forwarders that are willing to grow but not given an opportunity.	company
though company has taken lot of steps on learning and development of the staff- but this is one area where there is need for  further improvement	company
there should be more focused on the learning and development of the staff and regular training programmed should be implemented for the other work areas in the organization  if the employee wish to switched on too.	company
for ex, i think we should have access to the paperwork on the computer as you would on the floor and be trained on old systems.	company
the lack of money.	company
working processes which are very complicated and complex.	company
this not allow me to move on quickly.	company
customers needs is always developed so we need to learn more and more to satisfy customers needs	company
leaning and development	company
we need more training and development program periodically in order to support our job fulfillment in more efficient way.	company
so that they can be more educate/familiar about the environment and any kind of information needed.	company
we are no 1 forwarding company in the world.	company
for [company]-ofr should have new system that automatically update rather than manually update which will effect time and cost.	company

learning & development is still a work in progress, as though we know this is as much as the individuals responsibility as the managers, i have noticed that there is just not enough time to complete while also keeping company goals and workload.	company

it is unfathomable that a company as big as [company] cannot have better ways to organise office space so employees don't have to trip over cables everyday	company
not enough opportunity for career growth in us compared to other regions/country.	company
[company] needs to do better job supporting and promoting a positive work/life balance, and rewarding employees for going above and beyond.	company
for example, first choice awards should be brought back.	company
though a very very rare occurrence, a colleague or two hands over own responsibilities to others who are not related to the function.	company
this affects efficiency of others involved.	company
helps prevent the spread of sickness beyond the normal workplace illnesses.	company
which i think need  to be looked as one of the tools which will improve our potential	company
we need a/c warehouse in dwc,we need two days off  we need free transportation ,we need strong effective leadership as a manager.	company
acknowledge job well done, especially for those that have been with the company for some time but are continuously overlooked.	company
for tip of the hat, acknowledge non-management members only (managers make the big bucks & rewards).	company
the outdated and slow computers constantly hinder us from being as productive as we should be,	company

colleagues with the same profile make almost 40% more.	company
please consider ramadan timing working hours (specially airport team).	company
needs to improve is more on the resources that we have.	company
most of the chairs should be repaired, there is no available mouse for laptop user, and they need to evaluate or try to have the same salary that competitor offer so that we wont have attrition.	company
there are lots of negative feedback i hear inside our company regarding to senior managers, and it's kind of a making a negative impact especially to every employees.	company

sometimes concentrate some of kpi, new requriment, rather than reducing work.	company
needs improvement in quality of food services.	company

we need  better computers	company
need proper job distribution for each employees according to manpower's ability...  more effective & easy internal program(systems) focused on customer and employees	company
avoid the politics, example when changing the unit to new ones, they are prioritizing their close friends rather than those who needs to change the unit.	company
we need to improved for being more focus and dedicated to less error in our process	company
everything is still very much kept behind closed doors with minimal transparency.	company
employees must be overall satisfied  with their work	company
my supervisor does not seem interested in aloowing members of her team to learn other accounts that are apart of life science.	company
and first choice was also a great tool for morale which should be brought back.	company
i feel that merit increases should be given based off of individual performance which is not what happens at cae.	company
i also feel some sort of incentive program should be started, even if it is not the first choice program that was originally in place.	company
keeping good talent you will spend more money training new people only to have them leave once they become efficient because another company is willing to compensate them well.	company
sometimes major upfront cost actually save you money in the long run.	company
laptop operating system and tech specs for technical users/staff - better monitors at desks - food choices in bonn office - new hire training and onboarding	company
it equipment - wireless network connection, computer mouse, keyboards, laptops/desktop and projector inside the training rooms.	company

no last mins changes of orga/any annoucement  more learning/devolopement provided tat's neccessary(example imdg course / excel course)	company
1) as an employee we feel we do not have a work life balance, many staffs comes to work on weekend, late night to complete work and some even work from home which resulted less family time.	company
2) opportunity to grow with the company is very less.	company
-staff need motivation to continues improvement (recomment more award to give away expect only gem)	company

when we are working from home, incomplete resources are provide.	company
laptops are provided to do the work 24 by 7.	company
but what is the use of the laptop without the internet connection, kindly provide the same as dubai is becoming a costly affair.	company
we should be given opportunity to work in different dep shouldn't be ask to have the experience in the same field for selection; new person should be given opportunity; cross deparmnt training should be given to everyone	company
lengthy process which is time consuming-entering remarks in dtms,logis+running the reports + emails.	company

compensation needs to be more competitive	company
better training for employees who want to thrive and expand their options/goals through growth within the company.	company
it would be nice if the brokerage are for nbr gets recognized just as much as air & ocean.	company
its a little unfair that we do have the updated technology to do our jobs just as efficiently when we are on a bigger time crunch.	company
employee moral always can use a boost.	company
we work under stressful situations and do our best even without our merit raises or ace reward (0 inconsistencies on ext audit).	company
i believe that wages/salaries are not exactly realistic when compared to the amount of knowledge & work that is expected of employees especially since all of the new pgas.	company
i believe this is something that the company should take a deeper look into	company
there is no need of improvement.	company
recognition to employees as the $25 gift card incentive, this program has been cancel.	company
no team work.some of the managers actually encourage office politics and unhealthy rivalry and competition among their own staffs.management lacks concern for their staff.there is strong discrimination and partiality in our team.	company

pay us what we deserve!promote people who demonstrate leadership ability not b/c they are your buddy.actually use the eos for improvements in items we scored low in and not to promote your own agenda such as opening stations back up.	company
the amenities, more so the bathrooms/canteen but i understand this is in the works.	company
though we treat customer as the king, we need to attend to their general needs quickly.	company
also granting appropriate authority to execute the quality management and operational excellence initiatives.	company
not sure but i think it is the employee grading , even if we share almost the same profiles or jd, individual's grading are not the same which i believe may demoralize a member	company
it's a demotivating fact that the same position across another vertical has a better payscale/grade while my role although similar doesn't have a change in the grade nor pay.dissapointing	company
demotivating when you know what the average pay is at your grade and there is a high expectation to behave and perform at a much higher level than what you are at.	company
canteen needs improvement with its appearance as well as the quality of food being served.	company
[company] could work more in providing more opportunities for internal progress and generally in work by providing more options for rewards,stimulations and better financial conditions.	company

we are losing money, and can't get back to the number we had even 10 years ago, and it's not going to happen.	company
i know there is a plan in motion for the expansion but a good portion of the workforce are working in tight quarters.	company
could our office hours be changed to 0900-1800?	company
office copy machines dedicated to special accounts and departments, it's a waste of time to log in on the new ones takes to long.	company
special account group meeting to resolve issues related to the account.	company
instead of addressing this ahead of time and then making the best of a bad situation, the station made it worse with the restrictions and measure being enforced.	company
better technology for customer facing sales people, such as tablets and notebooks and other improved tools.	company
i understand why first choice honors were eliminated.	company
but in order to keep motivated  i believe we need to have some kind of incentive program.	company
although at this point i am also happy in the knowledge that i am still employed.	company
growth of each employee	company
provide room for improvement and stepping up in career.	company
poor facilities, constant noise, there are not enough restrooms for the quantity of staff, benefits were removed, work instruments are old and in poor condition.	company
i would really like to use [company] corporate wear.	company
anything [company] related is fantastic, i love my company and want to wear it to show it.	company
it would be nice to get the same at affordable pricing.	company
this results in not a good self-improvement, due too many tasks -> more chances on faults/errors -> not good for others teams working on your results	company
hr comunication skills need to be improved/moderate, internet connection to slow,replace pc/laptops,a lot of company rules like intercompany profit share,birocracy has to be restructurate and the most important the salary which is too low	company
we really need to change the workplace and have better condition to all staff	company

investment in work conditions to keep a minimum standard in the facilities.	company
equipments are downgraded and if upgrades are needed, it takes half year to process the request despite of the justification provided	company
one must learn to give credit where credit is due	company
workflow manuals are very vague, making me feel lost initially.	company
getting full timers to train newcomers ojt is not ideal, as they are busy, and they are not the best in communication.	company
need to put right person on the right place to ensure the delivery of quality for the job	company
company benefit shall be improve and revise	company
hope we can get the cleaner to do better in their work task.	company
motive 8 more depend on global result not individual hence difficult to get maximum result.	company
our system speed, quality and network bandwidth really needs to be improved...	company
we no pc cleaning services & pest control, why?	company
it need to be imporved,office faclity/infrastructure need to be imporved	company
it would be appreciated if rewards and awards are given to the middle level managers too which would be encouraging.	company
they are the ones focusing/balancing between employees and management in getting the visions and strategies, transpired into actions	company
system speed, printers etc.. need to be improved	company
people are not getting opportunity to grow in the system; there is a set of people, who are given multiple positions to manage, but the guys who actually deserves to be in the position is not being recognized.	company
infrastructure needs to be upgraded	company
staff promotion is one of the recognition and motivation to the staff who put lot of effort and contribution in company.	company
hope that it can keep to have staff promotion opportunity in every year.	company
needs more support in resources, such as manpower.	company
ceo's etc get rich off of our sweat aka the little people.	company
the current contract negotiations makes everyone doubt  security of job.	company
frt volume has decreased drastically which makes us believe frt is being diverted to other stations or arranged to avoid our services.	company
i think most employees are reluctant to learn new things and thus they do 20% rather than 100% because they cannot refuse the management request.	company
it would be nice if the option of giving first choice awards was available again.	company
stress levels high throughout the team due to being short staff then taking away first choice rewards.	company
if everyone gets the same merit increase then where's the motivation to do better than your colleagues.	company
in particular, improve the offices, while i do have everything that i need to do my tasks, the building where we are currently in needs to be improved.	company
it was a tough year based upon all the uncertainty and confusion and by cancelling raises, it sent the message that the efforts to push through were not recognized	company
there needs to be a clear plan for when  employees are sick/ill/require pto.	company
we cannot have employees at work without no equipment while waiting for their laptop to be fixed.	company
i realize that we are a large company, but i've never quite understood why everyone or no one receives a merit increase.	company
main reason for leaving is motivation for higher pay.	company
need to review & align remuneration structure by grade/position, for same position there is huge variance, which create demotivation to the employee.	company
there are systems out in the industry that are much more user friendly for employees and environmentally friendly.	company
emails paperwork directly from system rather than printing.	company
the company depends too much on email.	company
anyone with a desktop doesn't have full access to skype.there is a distrust of local senior management.	company
employees are over loaded with work and there is not enough man power to get the job done.people are working 50 - 70 hrs a week and being paid for 40.upper management relies too much on file count for employment of new people & that is not reliable.	company
[company] has a split between documentation and customer service,  but unfortunately this does not let no one take real ownership of the files.	company
roles have not been well defined as to who is doing what.& too many clock ins and outs, too many punches now.	company
when topic of diversity arises next yr, please try to be more actively/visibly involved with lgbtq community.	company
it's great that [company] actively recognizes different ethnicities/ genders-same emphasis/involvement should be visibly demonstrated with lgbtq.	company
we need company to be more focused towards individual's carrier and achievements.	company
company should give a chance to the member who have been in the organization for more than 2 or 3years or at least should be recognized by the company.	company
need to provide continuous cohesive environment with all departments.	company
"need to have leaders gain employees trust that ""open door"" does mean we are able to discuss anything and provide direction with follow up with what may be needed."	company
the struggle is real when it comes to expectations on our employees.	company
we as a company need to work on this quickly	company
my laptop is poor and slow.	company
need better password management where one password accesses all programs.	company
we need more opportunities for the non exempt staff to advance with more job opportunities, step ups even within the a roles and more financial improvements.	company
review of financials (i.e.high internal operating costs, p/s not being included in customer/file level reports, etc)-can make it challenging when doing analysis.	company
full and final settlement should be credited directly to the employees bank account who has resigned	company
chairs needs to be changes some have back pain issues.	company
need to improve job fulfillment	company
transport needs to improved	company
&  employee with more than 5 years of experience in [company] should get chance to develop their skill and get more responsibility to handle team.	company
actually , right now no improvement needed.	company
whatever plans we making its implementing very well.	company
still many things are to be improved or issues to be fixed at workplace.	company
also allowing all employees to equally participating or initiating a change they wish to get at workplace is what needs to be improved	company
policies, i was told that my promotion was rejected as i was not part of blp team.	company
however, there are couple of dy managers that were promoted who were not part of the blp team	company
administrative resources, like procurement for new suppliers.	company
process for cash back when paying for the company.	company
more ijps for vertical as well as lateral movement would be a welcome change.	company
the quality of tea and water needs to improve	company
need more growth opportunity	company
1.increment % is very upsetting due to which the attrition is impacted.	company
needs little bit more improvements	company
ambiguity comes especially when there is a cross functional change,the jd needs to be clarified and measurements outlined	company
lack of opportunities to advance.	company
it is very difficult to improve internally.	company
i feel that we go over and above expectations, but the value of the increments or the subject of raises is not always fruitful or received well	company
the discrimination needs to stop.	company
slow internet become a big problem, action as to be taken.	company
we need to be recognised as the most sensitive department who work tirelessly and effectively and have direct impact to company performance,we are not paid well according to our profession and we feel underated	company
company should take seriously allegations of intimidation and  threats from some senior colleagues and investigate adequately and create an ample and easy environment to work in.	company
career growth opportunities seem to be very slim becuase of less cfo positions.	company
there should be a plan to promote staff from one level to another	company
i believe there is still room for improvement in [company] nigeria and also i will like to state that i have been working with [company] nigeria for the past six years now as a non fte staff and up till now nothing has been done to improve my status.	company
thanks for the opportunity given to air my view.	company
everybody one to be in a place were he sees a brighter future.	company
the future is not clear as one works for years without promotion.	company
the workplace and working conditions need to be improved to motivate staff to give their best at work.	company
the whole company needs restructuring, new spirit, new energy and new approach of doing things.	company
still some improvement needed in terms of material/system.	company
we are really expecting to have cargo wise and to stop using logis.	company
the facilities are adequate, the management has tried very hard to keep them with quality, but technological equipment could be improved, because for example, the finance department works with databases and this requires operational machines.	company
it's oftentimes the same individuals who to the job and take care of a broad variety of topics.	company
scope of responsibilities are high and fulfilling, but regular 70h/ week is no long term approach and not doable.	company
time lost on those large data file while xls is processing or laptop freeze.	company
more powerful tools than msft office package and more powerful laptop should be made available on larger scale.	company
this type of behavior is unacceptable and only bring down the morale in the office down.	company

in order to meet kpis qtality 100 % we need more operation people.our small team has one people for export and one for import,they working as:customer service, invoicing,logis acounts and docs creation,inland transport aggangement,claim and insurance	company
stop our team leader from implementing unnecessary rules & regulations that do not benefit us but only for himself & thus making our lives so stressful & miserable that made some of our colleague reluctantly left us...so sad....	company
staff quality and levels need improving  team work needs improving, supervisors need improving so they have respect and are not seen as friends who people dont need to listened to, xray ops need showing that the job is worth the risk.	company
bring us more cargo and customers	company
overtime a few people wont do it as its not paid it always the same people staying to help the company to fulfill its role to the customer to get freight out on time	company
nothing to improve.	company
more trucks to deliver freight	company
to have more chances of doing something different not only the same tasks every day and night.	company
it would be great if ata costs can be transparent to business development teams.	company
first choice methodology should be embedded in our dna rather than more of a paper exercise.	company
streamline bid process & create more value in process.	company
focus on quality submission instead of trying to do more.	company
instead of assuming, leader should try the process to understand the pain faced.	company
-potentials should be given an opportunity to further their studies (e.g.	company
edm scanning and the computers connected to the scanners.	company
several qlinches were documents are scanned and they do not show up in navigator.	company
i think also they need to bring back first choice .	company
it give an incentive to work better.	company
i have seen alot of improvement in boosting team camaraderie this year.	company
in practice, direct managers have wide latitude to discourage their direct reports' interest and the opportunity to change positions.	company
in the recent visit by upper management i had the feeling they were only concerned with speaking as if they were politicians running for an office.	company
people are stretched very thin.	company
when times get rough and employees are asked to give more than 100% but are not shown the company actually appreciates them.	company
more appreciation for our hard work would be nice; a raise, bonus, bring back the first choice awards, etc.	company
i know we are short staffed but some people are causing more damage that good.	company
they promise you advancement but its a lie	company
off late all policy announcements have been de motivating, none of the new policy changes have been for employee benefit, making every employee feel, forget job security.	company
gives a feeling that organization is becoming more and more employee unfriendly	company
work loads continue to grow but nothing changes with the staffing issues.	company
as mentioned in box 42., one of the main concerns here is the rate of pay.	company
we need bigger monitors!	company
"we are still working off 17"" monitors and we are straining our eyes!"	company
"there are a lot of people with eye issues and there is no reason why we could not have monitors that are 23""!"	company
the sarnia office cleared more pars shipments last year than any other [company] global forwarding office in canada.	company
i respect that the bottom line is for our company to make a profit.	company
most times the human element is lost to financial gain.	company
a faster internet would improve productivity in the office.	company
i would like to see some new equipment implemented into the office.	company
our customers are asking for reports, data, electronic exchange of documents, etc.	company
and we are light years behind our competition.	company
{disaster management team)  3) skype should available to every employee  4) thin client desktop application.	company
required to set more hierarchy to increase opportunity.	company
management has to provide the support to ensure that employees are productive & happy.	company
[company] usa stations need to accept more ownership for temperature controlled shipments	company
methods to make plans effective need to be established, which are not only kept at the planning stage.	company
by all means, it does not represent the standards of a [company] office.	company
the only thing that needs to be improved is adding the replacement of the employees, as my self i can get 1 month vocation per year, but this hasn't been made since four years ago, i can't leave my work,koz i don't have b2b or replacement.	company
many of our employees and team leads complain that there is too much expectations / requirements within the work day to manage the job effectively as well as company initiatives.	company
work areas need to be established in order to complete tasks.tools  are required to complete certain task,such as hammers,snips.tools need to be returned after use so others may use them.work loads need to be dispersed among team members.	company
flexible working hors would be welcome.	company
home office (1-2 a month) would be welcome.	company
focus more on handling team capability and number of members which will assist to deliver service on time	company
high potential employees/jr leaders/sr leaders are still leaving the organization?	company
the business is draining many valued members of staff to a point of breaking and extremely low morale.	company
many business processes / decisions just take too long through to execution.	company
the new ice system for customs entries is a massive part of my job and can be improved greatly  i feel office dress code is an outdated concept and a modern workplace should relax this.	company
salaries for certain departments - some monday to friday  positions ( non managerial positions ) pay more than what shift workers get and they do all the weekends and unsociable hours and don't get paid enough for it ......	company
i believe that a nice tidy/neat environment can improves the mood of staff.	company
no growth in the team, no active lead on duty.	company
most communication is only for negative feedbacks.	company
employee should be treated and considered based on their strengths and value add and not anecdotal or feeling based especially toward those moved within bu's	company
my salary specifically [profanity] i know that i'm paid less than somebody who is more junior than me in terms of position and years of service.	company
i am concerned that we may have challenge to attract and retain talents as workplace can be one of the key consideration for potential employees in selecting his/her company	company
smt needs to be more approachable and open.	company
we have challenges for availability of mouse and keyboard.	company

need to align with effective time tracking system in place for each individual to see actual utilization	company
the commitment given to the employee while selecting for the job profile needs to be adhered to.	company
direct superiors should not listen only to one side.	company
"""political"" way here in the company is very strong."	company
it equipments like laptops, mouse, keyboard because some equipments is deffective like laptops with broken lan cable connectors	company
i hope to see expansion in the future.	company
expansion of employee, this only means gsc mnl is indeed in great demand when it comes to service	company
as per my opinion, none, [company] gsc is a great company since they are not just focusing on customers but also taking care of their employees.	company
they are doing their best to give the employees what they are worthy to receive	company
the company is perfect.	company
because, the company helps me to find the perfect team and people.	company
"i think the way the associate see's ""changes"" should be improved."	company
they need to see the positive side of the changes happening on this company.	company
we are spending too much time analysing solutions and consequently delaying on deliver.	company
we need to keep investing in system and process which i think will allow us to go to the next step in terms of service quality	company
we are in 2017 and still we use ms-office 2010.	company
having said the above, i am hoping that continuous improvement should be driven forth so we could successfully implement the strategies in place.	company
looking forward for continuous improvement from what we were are and what we should be.	company
- poor innovation, use of ancient tools to solve problems of nowadays.	company
- hiring massive off-shore teams for manual tasks that should be automated  - calling projects agile, but manage them as waterfall  - lack of tech.	company
suggestion: build a template of services used build process, let business then build a quote based on selections.	company
too many layers of approval on approval (and frequently reapproval) required.	company
cutting staff to save money consistently impedes our ability to deliver service quality.	company
there are less people in the group which means the knowledge has become very defined with those that are left.	company
there is a lot of emphasis on those individuals to take on more and more work from those that have left without gaining prior experience	company
need to simplify processes.	company
better it tools, not only tms but other reporting and trace and trucking systems to increase productivity.	company
we have to be continually innovating to stay ahead of the ever increasing demands of our industry.	company
data integrity and enhanced visibility via our systems are areas that come to mind.	company
no one application that i'm using provides accurate data that the customer is looking for.	company
we should be able to run a report ourselves without having to have one created specifically for the customer.	company
operational software both for air and ocean products.	company
senior management might need to consider details and plan accordingly before moving on with big changes.	company
within our team, we need more update re the eos actions throughout the year.	company
supervisor/management involvement in day-to-day is non-existent unless something is wrong and even then the responses are all reactive.	company
there is no focus on progression or improvement, rather focusing solely on doing enough to placate snr management	company
faster/quicker internet connection...a better system than logis.	company
[company] require a comprehensive quoting tool to incorporate freight rates and destination charges under on umbrella.	company
systems, processes talking to the people who actually do the job before changing a process	company

working with gsc, they continue to make the same errors, even after error logging.	company
there should be a minimum standard set for each branches productivity, if productivity is below expected standard then something should be done quickly to remove underperforming heads, rather than move heads to branches in need!	company
most countries try to improve their ebit by cheating other [company] countries on profit sharing.	company
we should rather focus on growing our clients base rather than making money out of each others	company
it is good to see change already started with irr.	company
there should be more active participation from hr for all kinds of employee support (including it requests)  [company] is market leader, however it seems that when it comes to process optimization through it systems, we can't just figure it out...	company
due to minimized level of employees there is no time left for contiunuous improvement ideas to implement and to be more sustainable in how we work	company
it should be given more possibilities to people (esp.	company
we need to simplify hr processes - focus on outcomes not audit process.	company
it would be interesting to get a referent france for each job by [company], one for ops export, ops import, cleareance ... to help to advise and harmonize  rmt is better but still missing price ...	company
people should keep to protocal with authorisations and email escalations.	company
review more processes within the company, simplify things instead of making them more complicated	company
irr is bringing a positive change.	company
should get implemented even faster.	company
follow through - we talk around topics too often and are afraid / reluctant to make a decision.	company
we must act when we see issues irrelevant of politics or personalities.	company
simplification of processes and speeding up of decision-making and implementation is still an issue	company
short term focus on file profitablity is good as at the same time we focus more on automation.	company
- sometimes we tend to discuss and analyse topics in length and then we miss the decision --> more decisions would be better	company
they need to learn how to buy space and know what the market rates are.	company
we are all over the board when it comes to rates, we are either low or high, we are never in the middle of the pack.	company
product improvement is key!	company
simplify and implement changes faster.	company
continue improvements in technology.	company
provide and improve web and mobile apps for customer facing information services.	company
gps tracking all shipments; email/text messaging to customer advising (accurate) estimated time of shipment delivery	company
we are too focused on saving money at the expense of success.	company
improvement to systems and processes to run a lean operation more efficiently.	company
perhaps more trainning/ learning be offered so we can get better and develop further to do our jobs even better and more effectively.	company
targeted purchasing for ocean and road shipping should be of strategic importance and handled with more resolution.	company
giving a platform to blue collar staff for  more ideas so that more improvements and reviews in the process are accomplished for better thereby saving time and making it easier to work	company
i think need to improve the machine like scanner rf and add training like safety using machines.	company
when we start to develop we need's to improve also.in case we are in same level.	company
so when we have more oppurtunities in case of both job and finance we would enhance the working place and company to certain level for growth...	company
i would like to become warehouse operator on the completion of 1 year of my service.	company

down level employees minimum demand approve .our situation and feel first prayority.	company
y8 service which impact our business seriously.	company
the service provider for mobile and data there are numerous call drops while on the phone which hampers clear communications within the team and with the clients.	company

our organization was changed several times through and after nfe, and we may still need to make role and responsiblities for each function more clear.	company
more open and effective dialogue session within teams helps eliminates miscommunication and changes perception towards one another.	company
this creates another level of understanding between team members that can go extra mile to achieve/deliver results.	company

first choice to be more visible and the tools utilised to improve processes.	company
it would seem that there have been very few first choice initiatives in recent years and those have been rolled out seem to have complicated process's more.	company
continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to improve products, services or processes.	company
these efforts can seek âincrementalâ improvement over time or âbreakthroughâ improvement all at once.	company
but we need to be also rewarded financially from time to time  bonus's could be an extra incentive to boost morale and improve all aspects of our roles at work.	company
change management.	company
very difficult to bring changes into the company	company
"however, within [company] ams we should be focusing more on ""improve your process""."	company
it seems this is forgotten if pressure rises and rework becomes unavoidable which eventually causes more pressure.	company

we need to invest in computer / laptop	company
site wide reporting tools needs to be centralized to have only one source of information.	company
continuous improvement to streamline internal processes and procedures to simplify things	company
suggestion on something new, we are not fast enough to embrace the changes due to our comfort zone or obstacles in the computer software or due to internal/external government regulations or the airlines requirements.	company
to have a effective sales team to bring in more businesses.	company
have experienced colleagues who actually are not open to changes (colleagues who are very old with the company), no knowledge about innovation and improvement.	company
we need to continuous improvement on all aspects to strikes better results.	company
allocation of work needs to be improved.	company
system or apps to make easier our works	company
without team work we cant do the company improvement projects.	company
i think that place want improvement.	company
employee attitudes, systems and procedures that are actually efficient in getting the job done right the first time.	company
customs clearance process still needs to be improve.	company
sector supervisors & managers needs to be engage to monitor what the priorities are(such as pending release shipments, customs exam or pga hold.)	company
not receiving complete updates at a timely manner.	company
system efficiency - currently we are using multiple systems which extends the time of processing for completing our task	company
record team at cae need to open the files quicker so the clearance can be speed up and customer can receive their cargo timely.	company
i feel customer service agents need to be implemented to handle all calls incoming to the station and that they need to be trained to answer the customers question and direct them where they need to go.	company
works loads need to revamped.	company
change is not good in itself.	company
it must be effective change.	company
there is too much emphasis on change to change.	company
finding that employees are spread thin and this is effecting the timely processing of files up to and including billing.	company
we also have an issue with customer service, in another company's areas doen't work to and that makes customers unhappy.	company
those who are working from long should get the senior position but jouniors are becomming our supervisors without any knowledge & we need to teach them to achive their kpi's.	company
equal opportunities should be given to all on depending on work .	company
company is considering the continuous improvement, which we are thankful for those done and currently implemented.	company
with this every one should exert effort and improve their quality/quantity of work in return's to company which is beneficial to both.	company
it negatively impacts our team and our customers.	company
the goal should be understanding the system not meeting a roll out deadline.	company
a more structural process among the stations, seems that even though we have best practices in place, not all stations (all products) seems to follow.	company
- late issue invoice by cdz and transport  - late pick up cheque because can pick up once a week  - cs ocean freight export delay response to customer (late booking confirm, no follow up)	company
need the system that user-friendly and flexible to interface with customer system.	company
need to improve the system.	company
again.. system need to  be improved in order to work efficiently.	company
and current system used is so old and un-efficient	company
internal process which require to be shorten	company
-please review process flow for the each department.	company
data sync between logis and tracker report has to be improve further	company
working situation  to be improved.	company
improve our quality of service from good to great	company
identification of current issues for preventive measures.	company
continually improving the quality of our products and services	company
it needs to improved lcl in terms of volume.	company
productivity need to be improved tremendously.	company
if company expect yearly +10% revenue with economic of scale(volume w/ marginal profit).	company
communications throughout all channels eg, cs/import ops must be clearly communicated to the extend of acknowledgement from receiving parties.	company
"make sure instructions relayed are action, instead of just sending e-mail & ""wash hand"""	company
there should be more activities for interest group and engage in more fitness class at a cheaper rates.air purifier should be install.	company
more efficiency for approval process	company
organizational effeciency within globe and china	company
might be better if simplify some procedures	company
[company] need to doing every campaign and objective continuously & consistently	company
accent is too strong and confusing.	company
maybe cut back on the amount of wasted paper that comes off the fax and printers the company could save money.	company
there are always processes that can be improved upon which are in the works now.	company
there are a lot up updates moving forward with systems that will be make a phenomenal difference in process times, billing and workflow.	company
in my opinion, there is always room for improvement.	company
pertaining to my role i think we need to work on creating better tools for pricing in order to compete, but i believe that is already being worked on.	company
technology and separating of [company] business units.	company
we are far behind the times or online tracking and tracing.	company
large disconnect between domestic and international business units.	company
ocean freight product- strong team, fast responding, customer care, responsible and strong in knowledge & experience are needed to improve our ocean freight product revenue/gp and motive the sales team to win more ocean freight businesses.	company
all is good so far we just need to have less manual work on our systems.	company
job closing procedure need to be upgraded.	company
a lot of papers are wasting with each files as supporting documents while closing files.	company
tracker need to be upgraded from excel to some online tool.	company
otherwise, management should provide transportation to sort the problem.	company
reduce manual data entries to enhance data integrity and accuracy.	company
sometimes no matter how much you double-check your work, mistakes always slip through the cracks.	company
nfe may have come and gone but the company is still blinded by notions and are following the same strategies under a different name.	company
we should learn from the past - listen to the ground staff.	company
we need a much more robust it department.	company
continued and ongoing but technology updates help make our system better and more efficient	company
better way of communications.	company
better way to have performance review.	company
software across the board, ftz always the last to be addressed for any software migration	company
we are also in need of additions to our managers in cae.	company
facilities standards and working conditions are inconsistent across sites and work needs to be done on some of the older facilities to maintain working standards for staff and aesthetic appeal to potential customers.	company
taking ownership, handover processes and the monitoring of gaps during handover in between shifts or when one employee fill the shoes of another	company
company need to promote advertisements	company
focus more on continuous process improvement projects	company
also request to consider placing a vending machine for snacks/juice in dafza office if possible.	company
the internal it system needs much upgrades, and the streamline between departments via systems needs better solution.	company
the way reports are kept ( manually) keeps us back when generating reports and reviewing internally for future improvements.	company
sap platform needs to be introduced for reducing workload	company
-existing implemented processes need to be more simplified and less time consuming.	company
we have to stick with our procedure so we have a clear cut about the process.	company
in this manner also there will be order and serve as our guide.	company
process and product	company
there are heaps of manual work that is to be done while processing shipments, where are different companies are moving towards automation we are moving to 80's	company
invoice quality and distribution needs to be improved.	company
there should be one centralised place to generate and send invoices like the nfe environment we had and ecc team lead by a supervisor.	company
our system and it infrastructure needs to be improved.	company
these days business intelligence is very important for any business to grow and sustain.	company
understanding of ocean freight particularity by warehouse and management.	company
strategy, priorities and improvement areas need to be taken on board by regional and country teams.	company
work efficiently and effectively on improvement areas.	company
make continuous improvement part of everyone's dna.	company
new system to have all department work on 1 system instead of various systems at the moment.	company
this is for encouraging efficiency and promoting greener company	company
i am happy with the current position of the company with regard to improving the business in all areas and do not have negative comments at this time	company
use of technology to improve systems	company
continuous improvement to keep up with the competition.	company
we are still operating in nfe environment we need to review process's and responsibilities to make our depts more efficient we are working hard not smart still and it is impacting our service delivery.	company
operations productivity  - not looking at the numbers file count  - over all the process and the customs service needs to be provided still in the export areas	company
staff levels - we are continually pushed to make improvements yet we are held back at a leadership level by not having enough staff in our teams to handle the day to day operations.	company
how does the company daily kpi work better?	company
e.g to encourage not to punish people who handle bigger accounts - the reality is that the more shipments you handle the more failure.	company
there are areas of our job that work ok but more time needs to be found in order to make positive changes to improve our performance for the team and our customers.	company
i believe [company] is behind with many it initiatives.	company
we don't provide an it initiatives to proactively ensure shipment meet the kpi's.	company
i am happy with the present conditions and always looking for improvement.	company
more focus on getting back to basics to many things that do not really add value to our direct job of keeping the customer happy	company
improve enhanced x-functional collaboration between teams.offer more empowerment to encourage entrepreneurial way of working	company
continuous improvement need to sustain over the year.	company
[company] will not stop continuous improve and develop strategy to meet target the provider of choice, the investment of choice & the employer of choice.	company
too many processes / complexity.	company
realistic kpi's that actually effect the business or clients.	company
not enough training to make that step.	company
daily pd impacts productivity   implement full transport workflow to include opl	company
incentive for sales to sell product based on profitability and not just files and volume, annual reviews of customer rates with auto cpi increases.	company
sell better and charge for all vas,	company
a better computer system / program in which we currently use and work with.	company
something more streamlined sooner rather than later.	company
great idea but overused and now employees feel it is hampering productivity.conducting pd's 2 days a week would be plenty to achieve required outcomes.	company
the system needs to improve	company
make a decision that's beneficial and sensible	company
big improvements needed in the us	company
cargo that is checked in and available in a.m should be able to be delivered same day without putting customer to ransom to pay express delivery charges.	company
eg: taking on more reasonability, clients, after hours works to befit their progression and the company.	company
better support from product management as we also seem to struggle with improving our services	company
although i believe they are valuable if we have them everyday it just becomes mundane.	company
we are continuously improving.	company
quoteshop system needs improvement, this is very useful however charges are not complete and sometimes we need to add missing charges and it consumes time.	company
look for additional ways for the continuous improvement for the company and employees as well.	company
for productivity, is not about the no of files/shipments handled, we may need to look into areas where jobs are carried out manually, customers' expectations/sops.	company
compared to previous kofax scan manager current datacap software requires much more time & effort to complete scanning tasks, especially so for pdf soft copies invoices plus supporting documents	company
compared to previous kofax scan manager current datacap software requires much more time & effort to complete scanning tasks, especially so for pdf soft copies invoices plus supporting documents.	company
there is always continuous improvement going on and we urge also that should be continue  in future as well.	company
improve team building  3.	company
in my opinion,the first thing that we need to improved from m&s department,  1.	company
we need system that online to all of department so we have same information detail of shipment	company
we need system that link each other so every body could know the update or have same information regarding detail of customer or shipment.	company
each job assigned need to be explained clearly by the supervisor to avoid any miscommunication.	company
stress management - it will impact staffs attitudes towards work & colleague  iii.leader as example - attitude, knowledge & build positive environment in department.	company
dare to admit mistake	company
hope the management able to consider in open hiring.	company
we need continuous improvement ,not focus on every year's audit or something like this	company
employees on execution levels must be increased instead of various managerial heads & systems should be improved as some of the existing software's/ systems are not customer friendly	company
: instead of scanning the docs we can set the edm link in the printer itself so that documents are upload in edm directly which will save time.	company
timely pre alert online, shipments update online, billing accuracy & formart	company
pls speed up the irr project progress in world wide, we are far behind our competitor who are more advagtage than us in digitalization, ie ups, kn.	company
top mgt should consider to optimize and streamline the structure to reduce cost and improve efficiency.	company
since service improvement is always everlasting to any service provider, a phased achievable improvement goal setup is significant so that everyone is able to feel the solid change.	company
shall have some improvement initiatives of daily work other than new projects.	company
we strive for improvement, as always.	company
but i really think we need more well-organized and detailed planning for any new changes, e.g.	company
policy, guideline, procedure, structure	company
be restricted to current structure and working mode, can't break to find out new area and chance to extend and improve	company
ord) may ease the situation in short term, but in long term, our us gateway'll never improve(because you're avoiding their problem that they should be facing)	company
need to be more effecient in daily process setup	company
our products are weaker and weaker, more expensive and less capacity, we donât have power with shipping lines, they do what they want with us, not honoring our agreements and we allowed excusing is market situation, our systems are too old.	company
we need better data to be able to analyze trends to offer more competitive and profitable rates to our customers.	company
our current systems and data don't allow us to see the full picture.	company
this is the most urgent issue.	company
rush for the deadline submission	company
allow a grace period for tardiness , act as if they understand life happens , and not act as if rid	company
when these ideas are brought up they are dismissed by senior management.	company
we should  have  better plan before when we need to change the new work structures or work process.	company
the tools needed to do my job effectively ,  user friendly systems (too slow), knowledgeable leaders.	company
training supervisor getting more involved and not neglecting the issues problems  custrmks needs to be updated if any changes.	company
in kc/bluebird, can the refresh button be moved on the taskbar to a different place?	company
it can still be on the taskbar, but it's too easy to accidentally hit it instead of the right arrow to move to the next screen.	company
more efficient ways to process larger shipments like makeup.	company
having customers with larger shipments have their invoices already uploaded or provide us with edi upload information.	company
sops should exist for every account.	company
every account should have updated contact information.	company
bonds should not be done at stations that rarely get them, especially since the new poa rule took effect.	company
i can see changes coming with technology but with nbr we certainly are behind compared to our competitors.	company
"continue to integrate as a company and work less ""silo oriented""."	company
m biggest struggle is working with our ocean import group.	company
for [company] routed ocean freight to sit in port without a clearance and no notice from that group is inexcusable to m	company
the telephone coverage in most (larger) [company] locations is not good.	company
often several calls are routed to the same person's voice mail.	company
after hours phone calls are often missed,with the closing of the [company] nat'l call center.	company
always room for improvement making changes with the time	company
office environments are old and unmotivating for 21st century.	company
cancelled need submit cfs original mate's receipt to exchange original fcr/bl as occurred a lots of complaint in the past.	company
we need more input and contribution from the management.	company
customer complaints should be taken seriously before it gets of point of escalation or out of hand.	company
our pricing is not competitive in most cases and we have to requite several times to get better pricing.	company
we need to get better pricing on the first attempt.	company
a centralized pricing platform and specialized quoting team.	company
the ocean and air pricing departments, they need to provide competitive rates when i ask for a quote.	company
motivate change of individual / support the changes and see through the whole process.	company
our rates requests from usa still take too long and in most cases are too high.	company
by the time we get our rates in line for the customer, they have moved on to using another forwarder.	company
from my position i point out reoccurring issues to stations and departments, but for the most part those issues are not addressed and continue to linger on.	company
escalations of the issues do not seem to have any effect either.	company
accountability and process improvement across the board.	company
the station directory is a great idea, but not all contacts are listed.	company
this reflects bad on the company and employees as well when a commitment falls through and customer/employee is unable to locate freight.	company
online forum to pitch the process improvement ideas.	company
need to continuously improve and should not just stop on what we used to do, we should learn to keep thinking what is best and what should the employees can do.	company
growing and developing each day would certainly be always open.	company
what i mean is that,  though i believe that our company is now growing, it's still better for it to continuously grow and developed from time to time for as long as it can benefit us.	company
communication, putting in copy those that may need the information.	company
continue with the continuous improvement process.	company
we need to get more people in each department with the years of experience and knowledge that can be transferred to the new and young employees of the company, so we all can take the company to new and better heights.	company
services needs to improved with systems in place	company
sales people should focus on selling only.	company
we need to be able to both sell and manage fcm that is the future of freight forwarding , both as an usp for sales and an information optimization tool for ops.	company
we don't seem to learn from previous mistakes (and not from previous successes either).	company
makes it frustrating to order new materials and other necessary items	company
maybe the systems that we work with.	company
comminications can always be better	company
as i work in the png environment, there are continuous improvements needed everyday.	company
we are still using duplicate systems i.e.	company
safety reporting manual and electronic which is wasteful e.g.	company
reporting incidents and hazards both written and electronic rubiq.	company
everyone needs to work as one team and remove barriers to create a shared culture of continued improvement.	company
we need to ensure that we keep alive all the great initiatives and programmes we roll out.	company
a lot of time and effort goes into the execution of these programmes and we need to ensure that we keep the messages active.	company
tms - system needs a major upgrade in all areas  the scanners current in use need a major upgrade the ones in use are unreliable have a lot of technical issue and are very cumbersome to use	company
i want to focus leaning and development.	company
empowerment has room to improvement but there is progress also so its in the right direction.	company
the first choice tools should be utilized more regularly, for identifying and resolving problems.	company
more training when it comes to products and processes	company
there is just too much time spent on reworking and correcting errors which is not productive.	company
suggest that if we can do continuous improvements at every operations & every processes, it will be more advantage for the company.	company
the technology/tools of work needs to be replaced with a more user friendly and effective ones.	company
today, [company] employees are working with a system that create too much manual work which keeps people overloaded and do the tasks that do not add value	company
we still need to train our managers to be the best they can be.	company
technology, most of the computers are obsolete.	company
laptops are  promised to some staff but not provided even if needed for the sake of business.	company
the pd process needs to be reviewed and improved.	company
we have far too many pd's going on which are conducted as they are mandatory rather than they provide much value.	company
negative productivity.	company
departments/branches need to actually want to work better with each other, too much us vs them mentality in the business.	company
take bottom up feedback  from smaller countries.	company
smaller countries to be invited in global meetings.	company
there is no specific are to choose.	company
dp [company] group always focuses on for the best.	company
the improvement should be continued.	company
keep it up what good things we done.	company
we need to be mindful of the changes in our business, disruptive innovations, technology impact on us to be future ready	company
policies that made smooth shipment	company
some taking much longer time to resolve the dispute vs 3 days closure on the issue log.	company
also, it might shorten the process timeline if able to.	company
need continuous improvement to achieve our strategy and vision.	company
quicker upgradation to latest industry software	company
need to concentrate continuous improvement in our service quality.	company
continuous improvement always required of our daily work place .other wise we can't expect better result.	company
operational work needs to improve	company
pricing procurement as compared to competition	company
the pace of new development.	company
as a brand [company] we need more business.	company
need to boost /encourage empolyee's development as well as company's one.	company
work process which create some tasks overlap & spent extra time	company
we are repeating the same mistakes and not able to evolve with better processes.	company
invoicing mistakes, communication with customers,lack of ownership while shipment execution and non adherence of kpis expected by customers (even if sop submitted)......	company
i think we need to focus more on continuous improvement plan, as the we are in service industry and market is changing very frequently.	company
better technology/automation so that productivity can be improved and work pressure can be reduced.	company
we are using 13 years old a/c and out of 3 ac one is working.	company
i feel we still doing more manual work & duplication of jobs for updation in logis after this gst & it take time consuming.	company
employees need to extend their timing to complete the task & may occur more errors while doing their jobs,	company
internal process to be streamlined	company
internal process need to be simplified	company
system upgrade needs to improve as current generation.	company
we need to do things improve cost effectivness	company
at present the waiting time at each tables are more and found delays in sharing the updates to customers.	company
we need to improve the accuracy and user friendly data in dhi reports	company
employee recognintions to be done basis of experience with company by way of providing promotions/special incremetns or grade change for every three/five years.	company
we have to sustain our momentum which we are lacking at times.	company
to take the lead & solve the issues with customer if any instead of passing the  issues  to others	company
looking for fine tune base working system in better way  more use friendly(logis)	company
it tools for custom visibility improvment.	company
the internal system could be more user friendly.	company
continuous improvement processes, share best practices or standardize more at the organization level.	company
i am in the finance department at jfk and i think we need to take this department more serious and add more man power to make sure we don't overpay or loose money for the company or loose accounts .	company
x-works payable system.	company
stronger sales and competitive pricing to bring more cargo into our facility.	company
i think that my scope can be expanded.	company
continue to improve collaboration between divisions.	company
"don't fix one problem just to create another somewhere else.root cause is not identified properly as we have the same issues constantly,meaning they are never really fixed and only bandaids put on issues ""for now"" & then back to the usual.also moral!"	company
there needs to be a consistent plan for moving forward on the ground level.	company
also we need employees in air exports!!!	company
we need help.	company
w/o any knowledge or refusing to know the root cause of every problem will not lead the company in a competitive environmen	company
we need to retake these processes to be able to remain better and more efficient.	company
too much time wasted on shipments will never handle, or only shipments received are misquoted at a loss.	company
i believe some of the tools being utilized on  a daily basis need to be improved.	company
supervisors need to be accountable not taken  at  face  value when  they place blame there are  too many family members here  and  there  are  clear  lines  drawn because of that  job  changes  are  made  then  changes  agin  without asking empl	company
1) more programs for employee critical thinking  2) providing continuous feedback  3) provide commercial/sales team with proper operations training to become more knowledgeable about our products.	company
everyday forwarding heroes applause award should come back great incentivetool	company
better visibility.	company
we must be able to have access to a modern operating platform.	company
we are significantly outclassed in this area.	company
we also need infrastructure in order to grow in a healthy fashion.	company
access to certain information/tools for my team to do our job effectively is missing.	company
sometimes the great ideas come from lower management within the organization but is not recognized	company
there's always room for improvement.	company
opportunities to moving up the corporate ladder.	company
many process improvement initiatives are driven from too many directions.	company
the process improvement flow should follow the organization reporting map.	company
ocean freight product needs further development on pricing and loss making business.	company
global bids are too complicated and create confusion for the teams, also, most are loss making business.	company
need to standardize our continuous improvement process in all products/dept.	company
improvement of individuals who are at associate level has to be decide.	company
i think improvement is one of the thing required or needed by every individual so hope in coming years there will be improvement at personal level in respect of position and money.	company
internal promotion there must be a target to managements promote employees to next level	company
more chances to be given for people to grow and move ahead	company
this kind of changes needs to be done continuously in future also.	company

everything is good and fine plus continues changes and improvements had made great for a work full environment.	company
hope more improvement and plans will be done in future for growth of individual with in the organization.	company
employee is not satisfied with company management.	company
there should be continuous improvement  which is there to do our best.	company
too much manual & repetitive data capturing is waste of time.	company
it does not add/enable value on processes to print docs from a system and data capture it in another system.	company
you are rather told on how to act than given an opportunity to bring your ideas to the business.	company
quick response to employee's concerns.	company
employee training need to be improved based on current market conditions	company
when trying to improve the work efficiency by implementing new processes and procedures, we need to consider more the impact that it will cause on the daily task of the employees as sometime the  end result do the opposite and  create more work.	company

despite everyone support from the line managers we still need to improve on our attire we need uniform to advertise our company for we are the legends of logistics and many areas which have not been mentioned since our stronghold respect our presence	company
all employees in [company] are entittled to continuos improvement so as to make our company more powerful and most recognised in the region and also for better of our future.	company
the frequency with which internal audits are conducted need be increased as continous improvement is an iso principle.	company
growth - stagnant, some experienced employees have remained in the same roles and this due to perception from smts.	company
improve storage capacity in servers.	company
i think it needs to continue with the engagement that leaders have, because results are being noticed little by little.	company
equipment is modernized but accessories, which are necessary so that the modernization has an impact, are not taken into account.	company
what was learned in first choice is not being implemented in all areas, this should be mandatory.	company
we need to improve on our internal commination,  improvement on staff tanning.	company

local management is focusing only with finacial increase without developing infrastructure within the company  many good hard working staff left due to this bad  experience	company
systematic - which is not in place so far.	company
internal workshops & seminars are required to combine the company's policy alongside with the current internal situation in the office.	company
we are improving everyday and here i will suggest that we should focus more on all our daily activities and handle them with our whole heart to get things more easier.	company
at some point, [company] acts as a slow and cumbersome machine due to complicated and poorly thought-out procedures.	company
this is something that can change to make our company more flexible and competitive.	company
-i am very dissatisfied witht he ppl company and their services, which are presented as a part of a [company] gf service.	company
sales team should go out and look for more business that will sustain our organization.	company

there should information which should be available before start of business, eg.	company
who to invoice, who the finance contacts are etc.	company

for each office  2.better i.t ie scanners and computer sytems that link into logis.	company
3.taking on our own staff so we can improve the quality.	company

we need better safety equipment to reduce the risk of injuries.	company
in my dept., we could use scanners or some type of technology to make our job more time effective.	company
our jobs in cfs need better strategies to make our jobs more efficient.	company
we need more buisness / cargo in our warehouse	company
this place needs clean house most of all the management need to be replaced bring [name] back	company
in my own department we have ancient it equipment that regularly lets us down and causes delays.	company
more follow up on actions taken and control points to avoid mistakes.	company
i think customer satisfaction can be improved by changing some existing global processes/structures that many times seem to interfere with a common sense solution or work counter-productive to gaining new business/offering better rates and quickly.	company
it's necessary to speed up the implementation of cutting-edge technologies.	company
system --- we need a more integrated system to generate our data or reports via one source	company
how we can gear up for the new way of working in future, we need more discussions in these areas	company
our product capability	company
too many report checking cause more workload.	company
we need one system instead of the fragmented approach to do our jobs more efficiently.	company
taking that communcation and turning into action	company
systems- with an understanding we have a new system implementation in the works.	company
it is and will always be a battle to gain symmetry in this organization.	company
management somewhat tries to make and follow through with changes and/or decisions they make, but it always falls short.	company
we have way to many different systems that we use.	company
also most everything is still manually  entered.	company
the edm has improved but can use some minor changes when imaging.	company
but our ops will be penalized for having too many manual hawb entries----	company
we need to focus more on the fundamental of freight forwarding, moving cargoes and making profit.	company
proper resources need to be made available to ensure we are compliant on all programs that [company] is certified in.	company
too many programs are not being supported properly, thus creating an atmosphere of reactiveness to any issue, that could have been avoided	company
computers are slow, new edm is worse, software is very old, and makes simple tasks twice as time consuming.	company
it renewal needs to speed up dramatically.	company
focus on enabling us to do better.	company
too much time / money wasted on irrelevant items.	company
no positive feedback from the company, only work harder.	company
continuous improvement of our company profits	company
modification of mart system to positively identify the responsible usa station based on hbl number.	company
there needs to be a greater focus and investment in technology.	company
we need to be more relevant from a marketing prospective as well as an operational perspective.	company
[company] is a convoluted and limited, needs to be multifunctional with data elements.	company
i think we have to be more pro active regarding the irregularities notification.	company
write any possible nonconformance and notifying customer on time must be improved.	company
too much moving around in sales teams/cssv.	company
cops continue to be an issue in that origin and destination do not always have the same version.	company
believe each cop should have an effective date and expiration date and a revision no.	company
for me it is continuous improvement.	company
because improvement is not in the first only, it should be continuous to have a good performance especially in the team.	company
our work stream needs more improvement as i believe management is aware of that.	company
just continue all the activities and projects we have so far and i hope there's more to come.	company
speed of connection on itmr4, still awaiting for it to come and visit have discussed twice with senior management.	company
our rfq review process needs improvement before it is sent to the customer or a contract is signed.	company
having moved to the organisation from [company], things like depict, first choice, go green should be embraced, but are not.	company
resources are insufficient to improve the quality of work.	company
technology - the laptops and phones need to be updated.	company
all of them,  this is 2017 we should be able to have updated, smaller laptops with all the bells and whistles.	company
we need to adopt innovative technology for work in efficient manner.	company
there are certain activities which can be cut down to shorten the process and cope up with the advance techniques used else where.	company
i can't comment on this as [company] is a big organization where all sections are always improved and as in my role i am always trying to improve my team performance and my work areas and supporting my tl and seniors and team	company
the quality of our services need to improve still  implementation of robust capas and proper follow up to assure improvement on the service  set up priorities and stick to them + communicate/provide a clear direction.	company
procurement systems are so process driven that we are filling forms for every email correspondence with procurement teams in my opinion is not productivity.	company
continuous improvement in the different processes.	company
connectivity between operating systems would show a reduction in errors as well as improved productivity	company
pricing and occ team need more improvement	company
it is most important to continue development and harmony with improved technology.	company
faster resolution on problems need to been increased.	company
winning new business and retaining current business, we seem to be losing a lot to other agents	company
improved data in order to analyse our customer base, thus providing clarity around profitability and what customers we need to focus on, be they profitable or potentially profitable.	company
why [company] hayes do not invest money and buy xray machine similar to freightnet's one and safe money in close future?	company
quality must improve on the desk	company
airfreight knowledge at branch level.	company
recruitment quality across the business, and signing off atr's sooner.	company
adding complexity to the operation with two export depots has not helped.mistakes by branches and transport over deliveries.	company
we need to get ahead of the game to stay ahead of the competition.	company
i think our it systems are a huge barrier to driving our business forward, and make people feel like they are working in the past.	company
some management seem to be stuck in their ways.we have moved on from 15 years ago & things can be done differently to not only help our customers but ourselves!embrace it!	company
we need to take quicker decisions about improving and/or adapting our systems.	company
the organization has to improve in sustaining the initiatives that they have started and to ensure that it is fully understood by all.	company
the required changes need to be instigated quickly - not drawn out.	company
i think our systems should be improved as we have to do so many reports manually	company
relationship with the business for projects needs to be improved and the right people need to be involved from the start of the project.	company
business needs to take responsibility and not leave everything to buit.this will improve overall project delivery	company
prioritisation to enable people to do a good job rather than constantly fire-fighting requests	company
"the roile of bpo need an re-shaping - seems stuck in development, as they do what they ""always"" did."	company
should work on system which can help to track the attendance automatically i.e.	company
as and whenever we have highlighted our concerns to our team manager, the same gets resolved and we get a probable solutions for our problems.	company
all are going good, just remain the same in future and improve continuously.	company
as an [company] employee i am very proud to work in such a encouraging environment.	company
[company] always ready to adopt the changes as required and this is makes [company] market leader this is because of continuous improvement in the organization.	company
leave management could be better managed as i see gap between employees and organization, though employee have the benefits however shouldn't be misused.	company
perhaps we can look as to how we can lean/improve the internal processes.	company
having 1 source file of everything so we can just dump any additional and has the ability to extract the said set of information if needed.	company
maybe more faster response on materials we are using.	company
like mouse keyboard and other since its one of the things we need while working because requesting for new mouse or keyboard takes a long time.	company
it has effect on our work.	company
hear your employees voice.	company
continuous improvement for the growth of company.	company
continuous improvement because for years i've been in the company i've seen and experience all the changes and improvements that every employees need.	company
continues improvement to our company is the best way to have a strong company and continuous providing jobs can offer to all the people need to have work.	company
continuous improvement on current rules and regulation.	company
on my perspective, i'm satisfied of all the improvements that company has exerting and implementing as of now.	company
what i suggest is this will continue on a long run.	company
for me is continuously improvement	company
processes that needs to be streamlined or simplified	company
for me continuous improvement is the one to be improved more.	company
more efficiency in trans departments work	company
greater understand regarding the competitiveness of ocean pricing and what is required to gain additional business.	company
takes too long to implement changes that will fix or streamline processes.	company
more often than i should, i am engaged in escalations, push back on requests, and involved in requests that are to determine where to point blame.	company
they should ask the employees about that and also check with other companies how they managed this kind of situations.	company
[company] supply chain encountering too many obstacles at local level when dealing with global customer	company
believe employment enrolment could be made easier,  we seem to be chasing our tail all the time between replacing staff members and have to start staff with lack of proper training, because it has taken so long to get approval for a replacement	company
the actions, orders and instructions of the managers often contradict 'our values'...	company
the board should provide more support for law and compliance issues.	company
we need to continue to be patient with ensuring the company turns the corner financially.	company
sometimes when you hurry to fix things, you create bigger problems.	company
management seems rather interested in ignoring those ideas and continuing the 'old-fashioned' way of doing business.	company
it would be nice if our leaders could take decisions, accordingly, and if they could implement them, accordingly.	company
i satisfied from my supervisor and company	company
i have discovered in the short time have been here that there is low responsibility among our working groups may be people need some training in that so that they get engeged at work.	company
[company] stations from various countries are separate financial entities and protect their own interests,which leads to financial,operational and contractual disagreements between stations/countries-affecting service given to customers	company
need many actions between personal members.	company
understandably since llp is a new concept, improvements in communication and team (department) structure is needed however is in progress.	company
too many restrictions as to be able to approach suppliers for getting our work done which hinders our response time to customers.	company
pricing and response times	company
i would like to have more bussiness for global forwarding	company
sometimes is neccesary to know more about the consecuences of to do in a bad way our duties.	company
room for improvement in our center	company
1) facilities - toulet / pantry / printing toner need improvemet.	company
2) relarionship between superior & staff -  is advisable to know what problem that a staff face instead of judge their productivities by using file counts.	company
when every shipment is important, every customer is important!	company
let what  other sector do their job right and not correcting them all the times,	company
every month, a lot of staffs resign & new employees are joining.	company
management board should consider seriously this situation & must take countermeasure asap.	company
prefer every & each one from team take own responsible to work together on every errors done & share to solve it .	company
let us improve the number of working hours to have more time on our family.	company
i think this has been the biggest challenge this year and since hiring new employess is not an option i believe we all need to work together to manage our tasks	company
i also wish that our incentives and raises here at cae in us were not only based on us profit	company
more new business	company
looking at the costs spent across departments when we are trying to improve profits on files/jobs.	company
that each person is aware that the task they do is not isolated to there own area, that how they function and respond does has a flown on effect	company
especially in high volume days, it might help us become more flexible as a unit and able to help others more responsively.	company
it is undisputable necessity to have clearly defined group responsibilities to avoid overlap functions and duplicate actions when pleasing customers or when targeting organizational goals.	company
i guess each and every member of the team should be equally devoted and responsible to get the job done.	company
our all team members should know the strategy to work in local markets, here i suggest that keeping in view our all [company] policies we need to improve our services level either provided by a spo or anybody else, who takes the ownership to done job	company
improve turn around time for payroll adjustments like vl, sl etc.	company
sometimes it takes months to reflect the adjusted numbers.	company
my observation - each and every individual of the company (cs/sales/ops) is extremely overloaded and stretched.	company
hence everybody first needs to understand the value of the shipment.	company
increase group responsibility to make the good output for company	company
need group support for us to compete our competitor	company
there are still lacking of act of an ownership if issue rises.	company
pin pointing is a norm.	company
there are still some challenges to define the different team's resposibility and goal.	company
our phone system.	company
i had a customer call and was extremely upset that he could not locate his shipment on our website and had been transferred 5 times on our phone system.	company
in the end, his call was domestic and i helpep.	company
helping each other and respect for one another.	company
invoicing will require a total revamp of the process.	company
customer need a faster response time when quoting ocean container shipments.	company
too often in this company, inaction is tolerated.	company
whether it is unanswered e-mails, unactioned requests for support from management, or inaction at the desk level.	company
lack of communication and being told something else is always more important or takes priority over your requests /customer.	company
it is essential to have a better communication and help more other teams.	company
local countries/departsment are allowed to work on own narrow-minded agendas that jeopardize costumer relationship wordwide.	company
we need to stop suboptimization, work as a true global team, recoqnize one's own responsibility for the entire [company] group	company
for nfe one account one cdz one csu might of worked but not now.	company
there is a lack of team cohesion across departments and an unwillingness to anything that is not ones job.	company
i'm not completely convinced whether some areas / aspects of the company activities are conducted in an ethical manner.	company
everyone in this company need to bark up and look seriously on our financial on the financial view.	company
to make sure those shipment arrange with good margin and profitable, in current world economy structure we need to be more selective on what we handle	company
if this company gives more development to the all employee for the further education to the serve of [company] ff  customer escalation counter for the flash shipments and it will gives message from origin to destination all the levels of process hod's/rd	company
mistakes are done by humans but we should learn from our mistakes & should strive that the mistake is not repeated.	company
net work may be more eventual	company
yes - afr team has to take an intiative to challenge the future goal to be achieved ( âindiaâs most customer centric logistics company, simplifying trade with the worldâ)  every individual has to count on same to full fill the given commitment.	company
team work is still lacking even after cif /wtmc sessions, collective ownership is missing only few people frm each dept are taking ownership.escalations with products-hod ,not getting response unless cs/tl follow up in person.	company
the ex-works application needs to be improved or re-moved.... the (billing ) part is suffering making my company loose revenue.	company
across the board communication not just a select group with secretive like motives.	company
i actively look for solutions / improvements across all accounts, this is not always positively received by all members due to the individual account responsibility.	company
this has been raised and addressed by the new management who have provided support.	company
air export processes and communication to warehouse	company
retraining and everyone needs to understand how to do cs/hawb and all... crosstrain	company
communcation with my direct report could be a lot better.	company
warehouse is extremely segregated and not willing to help one another.	company
the work load needs to be looked at.	company
it is hard to influence staff members when they see that different sets of rules or standards apply to different personnel.	company
i have seen a lot of lost business recently and noticed poor implementation of new business.	company
there are good processes in place but they are not being adhered to in many cases.	company
shipping co's need to be adaptive to grow.	company
responsibility as as group should be improved when anything goes wrong	company
general knowledge of freight forwarding in our company.	company
we need to improve internal gtwy costs.	company
gateway achieved costs might not be the best tool for pricing if most shipments are moving directly from local stations.	company
building up a spacious place to carry daily workout routine  in short gym where we can be fit & healthy along with the work we enjoy all together.	company
this need to be improve	company
need to have attendance incentive, as this will encourage people to come regularly	company
everyone has their own understanding of there objectives and goals however they do not understand how every departments relies on one other to work together!	company
"i request to be careful in deciding to hit the ""print"" and take hard copy of paper print outs."	company
not only this impacts on environment but also on costs of operation for [company]	company
inter department communication is vital to make sure the message flows from commercial to operations	company
management support  in terms of  future development in other departments and career development,  be fair with salaries & close the big gaps between employees  whom they are working in the same level	company
the way that we need to ask for a quote is not really efficient...	company
the effects of a transparent company culture impact the entire organization and the people it serves.	company
please stop retrenching people and if you have to then deep dive first to ensure you are retrenching the right people and not just numbers.	company
a better control of hours of entry to work, because in some areas preferences are seen with specific people.	company
we urgently need commercial mgr and a sound team to drive the business and win more customers to ensure a quick turn around.	company
employee's remuneration and motivation in my station is very poor.	company
necessary equipment (e.g [company] owned trucks for containers delivery) that would make us compete favourably in the market as a logistic company are not in place.	company
selection of candidates for the next level opportunity need to be aligned as the ones who are considered to be falling under high potential have been ignored.	company
part of it is the concept known as collective guilt by which individuals who are part of such collectives to be responsible for other people's actions and occurrences by tolerating, ignoring, or harboring them, without actively engaging.	company
our customer service team, ocean freight, customs team are considering the warehouse team as a different company so that actual result will not get and the customers will not be happy.	company
we should have the latest crm / sap should be implemented for all products, this make us	company
my company very good!	company
we need to be more consistent on our approach towards the business, we tend to fluctuate a lot in terms of the direction we are taking.	company
as the numbers achieved so far is less than the aspiration/budget, the team has to really focus on the volume of bc customers for at least next few months.	company
leadership from the higher management and recognition when the imposable gets done well and the highter management team to work as a team with the lower grade to make it work...  works coming up but the morals of the company are slipping?	company
quality of staff could be a lot better	company
my current team members seem to have issues adapting to a multi-role, multi-task based work method.	company
corporate can do a better job of projecting these new philosophies to the older staff to encourage them to embrace change.	company
the continuous grey area of who to do what questions:-  1) regional implementation or country implementation?	company
example (origin/destination/sales person)	company
need more help.	company
need help from other [company] offices to get information and rate tools that are needed in a timely manner,and getting issues resolved in a timely manner.	company
receiving a complete set of docs from overseas, in order to bill the u.s. customer.	company
i believe for most shipment moves, the ownership of a file should be at desk agent level.	company
so rev and costs be entered in same month, and report and try to avoid loss file	company
what needs to improved is the errors that we have each month, lessen the error, be keen to every details/required of each customers.	company
our working group needs a little improvement!	company
ex: mont office has many accts that they are noted to soley handle (until afterhours) however, they decide when and what they want to clear, removing these notes designating it as their account, and expcext [name] to clear all.	company
make [company] standards in all countries similar	company
decision making, a five year plan, where does the company see itself, without these there will not be a company in the uk, lets be proactive not re-active ( lets not change for sake lets change for the future)	company
the refusal in particular of asia to refuse to move loss-making or zero margin shipment jeopardises business and is short-sighted, particularly when such business has been profitable all year.	company
uk focus remains on making business more profitable	company
global initiative awareness  2.	company
it, micromanagement from global, too many kpis, no accountability in many areas, too much cost in global overheads, dtd does not work, ...	company
immediate response provided by it should be improved.	company
hoping that they should be more alert when fixing issues, especially applications related ones.	company
they will not be called or asked for help if the agent or the person can fix the issues themselves.	company
we take too long to take decisions and move forward in canada.	company
the it system is a little slow and logis is outdated.	company
however, i understand both of these matters are being updated over the next 2-3 years, globally, so it's only the timeframe that could use improvement.	company
this is causing most of the iteration.	company
it security is strict but in such an extreme way as to hamper our ability to do our jobs efficiently.	company
the ticketing system for emergencies needs to be changed to make it easier to open an e ticket that is urgent and needs quick resolution.	company
in the last years too many apprentices were taken on, i'm afraid that it lowers the company quality.	company
it's okay for some years in order to lower the costs, but on the long time who will pay this strategy?	company
when a decision made; upper management should consider all the levels affected by that decision.	company
in my division we are going through a big change but our opinion was not taken into consideration.	company
turnaround time for receiving pricing from overseas countries.	company
we need a system that provides complete financial reports.	company
too many handoffs leads to many errors and a lack of accountability.	company
kpi's should focus on areas that will have a direct, positive impact on our customer's experience with [company].	company
it, visibility to shipment details.	company
a lot of duplicate work because our systems don't talk to each other or are unreliable	company
the need for additional resources (fte's)	company
we need new it we need the senior management team to lead the business.	company
as accompany we have lost too much knowledge/experience, with too many fragmented processes,with many teams performing a small part of a process, resulting in lack of commitment/accountability/understanding,with a do your bit & pass it on mentality	company
profit but a lot down to exchange rate between stg + euro.	company
too much work with laborious systems.	company
customer is allowed to call the shots on everything.	company
my chair has broken, it keeps lowering which courses discomfort while typing and doing my every day job and every so often i have to keep adjusting it.	company
at the moment we have web pages, logis and excel spread sheets to work from and this can get confusing, especially when training new staff.	company
i don't feel we have had sufficient sales representation in the ema region for a long while now and could be missing out on potential new business.	company
every single person in liverpool branch is working invisible hours not known by senior management to ensure the job gets done, people are starting to become exhausted.we need senior management to act on recruitment requests quicker	company
lpl have struggled for most of the year after winning new business and smt slow on providing sign off for new heads to in order to keep business flowing.	company
seems to be appear a lack of clear leadership, direction and organisation.	company
we carry too many poor quality / unmotivated staff who are simply not capable /interested in moving the company forward.	company
- [company]s continuous improvement initiatives are not affective, gccs is fundamentally flawed.	company
sevral new additions in the last year have ot been up to the required standard of freight forwarding, why the mangement would fill an operators position that is solely airfreight with a person that is trained solely in ocean freight is beyond me	company
work ethics need addressing - why is it ok for staff to do as they please while others are busy and working all hours	company
we are heavily reliant on operational team members in the afr & ofr departments, who are sometimes too focussed elsewhere to support cdz	company
lack of finance is understandable due to the companies situation at the moment but further investment in technology i feel would bring benefits in efficiency.	company
not always easy to determine roles and responsablities in the decision making process.	company
generally fall compliance with certain values.	company
risk of frustration/failure due to unachievable targets, costs savings and all projects (irr/cw1)	company
tms project very important	company
operational system support/training structure;  lack of visibility/training in projects (label, edm, esp);  still too many organizational changes;  loss of key personnel;  closer hr-employee career steering and job profile matching.	company
the ability to recognize employees within the company for a job well done.	company
technology within [company] needs to be improved to ensure we have the tools needed to do our jobs successfully.	company
i feel that our agents are having trouble getting necessary document in a timely fashion.	company
we have some needs to be improve from our company.	company
too many manual processes.... too many inconsistencies  training new employees takes way too long because the level of inconsistent responsibilities from customer to customer and lane to lane has gotten out of control.	company
after resting we can do more good works for our company.	company
my feel our company  graet.......	company
-it is not right or fair to punish employees with warning  letters for non repeated mistakes.	company
we need quality dress  we need paid holiday on omra time	company
we need paid leave of umra.we need quality dress	company
we need free trsnsport  we need two off weekly  we need good quality dress  we need paid leave on umra and hajj time  we need yearly incremnets and bonus	company
we need free transpotation.	company
we need quality dress.	company
yearly bonus we required.we need a good safety shoes.we need a good increment every year.we need twodays off in a week as we requested last 3 year.no action taken by the management.our office staff working with us same timing but they have twodaysoff	company
safety grievance redressal forum to be implemented inside warehouse  warehouse damages to be addressed as soon as floor team escalate issues.	company
we need weekly two off  we need yearly bonus and incremnet  we nees good and quality dress  we need paid vacation on umra time.	company
i have only one suggestion about my concerns to company..	company
increment should be decent enough to motivate us doing our best.	company
supervisors need to give respect to all the staff from higher to lower	company
everything is good iam very happy	company
i need to work in different department for the knowledge to support the company,	company
some time suppervisoer not issude our urgent situation.	company
too many report need revert	company
globalize unified standards of quote to eliminate unecessary arguement and extra workload.	company
it need to be update now	company
deal with bad weather emergency better...like typhoon	company
difficult to say that it renewal&enhancements should be more locarized in order to keep up with local market situation to get more biz with trust way .global alignment is key for success but it needs a bit more tunings at country level with flexible	company
i think human resource is top priority for any business/company.	company
network support, rates and cooperation beteween countries	company
car park, daily free fruits to be healthy and work effectively.	company
[company] needs to become less tied down in administration and more focused on getting the job done.	company
people should be treated as individuals and on their merits, hard/good work should not be an opening to assign more work.	company
awareness of work/life balance to stay healthy and focused	company
ongoing it problems (outlook, sci).	company
ongoing misalignment between sales/operations/customer.	company
feedback still limited to 250 characters.	company
materials we use to work : software / computer...  trainings (example: we had to work for new countries but we didn't have information about it: contacts / process/...)	company
i was hoping that could continue.	company
fte freeze = appointments of staff to roles, rather than proper recruiting process	company
since we are working for boeing & aviall accounts, management should sincerely consider to reimburse us adequately.	company
though being selected for an higher position,the confirmation has being pending since a very long time.this has demoralized me continuing further with this company.	company
increment elevation to a decent extent should be taken into consideration.this will motivate the productivity for sure.	company
provide good fruits every weekly, 01 month medical team check each every staff.	company
's future strategy & vision.	company
further simplification, to allow room for people to focus on more important topics & be more efficient, productive & motivated.	company
improvement scope is always there	company
sales team must bring more business, as we have very less sold biz by sales, must bring new customers.	company
more business ,we have more capacity to do	company
more business for cbc clearance	company
required health and safety ,employee madical card for any health issue, required a new equipments and more space at wroking place need management to check the work envoriment and improve.	company
healt and safety is required, required additional place and equipment to work,	company
management to review the kpi measurement.	company
for me, every corner of this organization are well monitored by the management and there are the employee engagement projects that will improve the least part of it.	company
all management team (chead, sdh, hr, finance, tm, tl) need to improve the mindset that their are not only working in company, they need to consider other employees as well on their action.	company
2- thought process and work ethics should be modified.	company
one individual should be best in the selective process.	company
aspiring candidates those who knows the work well still seeking for the growth and ctc in the organization which needs to improve.	company
to much internal burecratic - profit share, danmar concept, kpi ect.	company
it systems, we are way behind our competitors.	company
cross cultural training, as per reporting point of view we should aware about each and every process in [company].	company
there should be more engagement in the growth of an employee.	company
this helps in queries getting addressed timely.	company
we need better technology resources than our logis system	company
but never successfully for improvement.	company
when we have issues with passwords, logins, or acces , the wait is quite long.	company
fair chance should be given to everyone.	company
yes looking forward for some improvement as need jacket for winter...	company
a proper alignment of org-structure and equivalent remunerations should be done across organization as currently disparity prevails when you compare between department and divisions.	company
transportation facility needs to be improved.	company
review the assetless policy - deugro are stealing the market share by specializing and owning equipment for projects.	company
cost advantage.	company
we need more business, more customers and freight.	company
need to provide basic supplies such as writeout tape, the supply shelves always empty, employee has to buy their own supply,very sad.	company
we still struggle as a company to be proactive, mostly around staffing challenges for increased / new business opportunities.	company
the hr approval process is cumbersome and creates delays to even utilize temp employees as a stop gap.	company
1.fico has so many checking report which takes time to verify and reply	company
every year this eos is done, nothing changes.	company
processes must be streamlined was feedback frm senior managemen	company
external training must be given for the fic / team leaders / warehouse supervisors  2. bus service mb arrives 30 mins early and leaves 30 mins late from work, and also collects staff from other companies.	company
this needs to change	company
we need paid holidays on umra time.	company
as we have staff from different nationality ,celebration has been done only for onam & christmas but i haven't seen eid celebration for muslim staff in past years .	company
process remapping is required and is in progress.	company
which is really unfair and need to be changed and bought in the same level as the output is the same.	company
full insurance for spouse  office time to be changed to avoid traffic 7am to 4pm	company
eg.. last week there was a health talk about spinal problem and neck pain issues... but it's arranged at 3pm...	company
there is not much improvement needed at the moment	company
1.should enhance the welfare to meet the cpa growth	company
at one point this company had great leadership and [company] atl was station of the month nearly every month for years.	company
promoting the [company] brand in the workplace.	company
i think communication overall need improvement.	company
this company seems to be taking a turn for the worst.	company
there should be more cell phone, smoking break etc rules	company
we could always use more $$$  bring back first choice honors, so we can recognize our fellow colleagues.	company
i understand this is cumbersome task particularly when working with global accounts, they are not black and white or specific to a region leading to misinterpretation and increased cca.	company
the on boarding process for new employees.	company
develop a mindset where we can have more shipments on profit or with good margins.	company
faster internet, sometimes programs are working very slow.	company
need improvement for office working environment.	company
system that we use must be user friendly	company
1. functions needs to take up the ownership by giving update timely and not wait for multiple reminders or escalation  2.	company
system needs to be upgrade to keep up with the current system in the market (eg: microsoft / windows)	company
- products and their prices (ofr especially, lcl within ofr especially).	company
- focus on administration is too high.	company
that might change as well.	company
it is a little bit smaller compared to other company and needs to be competitive to them to avoid the attrition.	company
for emergency purposes, lack of immediate response like for example in earthquakes .	company
[company] is the best, i love here.	company
no place need to improvemnt	company
-to much follow up, reports etc.	company
instead of directly focusing on the customer needs, we are over analyzing basic needs.	company
employees who sleep at their desk, use their cell phones while at their desk, disrespect to other employees needs to be addressed.	company
communication  all around if communication is worked on and successful then the business would be more successful and everyone would understand where they stand with the company as well as their job.	company

kronos payroll reporting system is out of date and needs to be replaced with a more robust and user friendly web application.	company
you can't always count on kpi's to give you an accurate picture on the amount of people to get the job done within a department.	company
recruitment process - referral is ok but recruitment team should scrutinize the person being recruited of its capabilities, experience and expertise instead of just accepting because he/she is referred by a person who is with position.	company
team work is important for growth and better understanding,  all the dept, and within team should work as one to the future fulfillment of our statergy  plan - half yearly there should be a awareness programme for development of our unity within all.	company
we need more managers to replace the ones that were lost and senior import manager.	company
communication is spotty and generally only in one format - example - town halls - if you can't make the th, you're shucks out of luck - there's no email recap or even high points posted anywhere.	company
when new systems are rolled out we need more time to work with the new systems before taken and old system away because when new systems are coming out and don't work the old should still be available for us to work.	company
the moral of the company is not good at all because we work hard for the company, there we expect something in return.	company
to further improve, the complaints from employees need to be taken seriously.	company
i think it was wrong to take the gift card incentives away.	company

the building needs work, heating and cooling are in great need of repair.	company

the systems are extremely slow and frustrating.	company
systems that work more quickly and efficiently, just using ups to print labels takes approx 40 mins.	company
internet is way too slow to support usage of systems.	company
also kc and alliance are consistantly slow and in turn unproductive.	company
everything -  we need to have real accounts that make money for the company not those that don't pay and are worthless.	company
i find it very disappointing that our wages are frozen without any communication as to when it would be possible.	company

operating off of old / underpowered computers hurts my ability to be quick and responsive with my work.	company
i need to highlight a very important point here which i had also mentioned in my last survey -  all festivals are celebrates in the company except eid, which is a bit frustrating for muslim employees.	company
looking at the drastic changes over these years, i personally do not see anything that has to be changed however if there could be more expansion of team then managing work during anyone's absence would be carried more at ease.	company
this way we can have a healthy discussion with the employees and mark them high or low based on their performance and feedback can be given on areas for improvement	company
there has to be a clear line in the chain of command and how to communicate effectively.	company
management has to be empowered to keep staff in line with the help of hr and what counts for one should count for all	company
why is forwarding always struggling?	company
others do not enforce the rules/guidelines for their people which we all are to follow.	company
the development of systems and equipment	company
the ftz was not considered when kewill was chosen as the new cdz system and it has created many issues.	company
also, the new ftz software gtk was not robust enough to handle our business requirements.	company
we are very much behind compared with other forwarders when talking about it systems.	company

internet connections are often terable, so in times of rush work can be very stressfull.	company

getting through to those customers who expect more; more clearances, reports etc but paying less.	company

better understanding when bringing on a customer as to the complexities of the work and ensuring we are making enough money to cover,also not relying on file count per fte to justify workload due to complexities of many jobs, compliance & integrity.	company
even if not compulsory to wear every day, they can be very beneficial for various reasons and create a [company] business imag	company
also our ability to deliver cargo in a timely manner / when checked in not next day	company
too many systems that are not interconnected, it would be good to see what steps are being taken towards a unified system (if any)?	company
maybe a little more positive feedback from senior management	company
everything else, year after year we are told we make billions of dollars yet every year (except this one) we are told no bonus because the company isnt doing well...  pay rise's are insignificant not even in line with the gdp increase..	company

the ocean product needs to be more competitive.	company
i have worked at [company] for 9 months now and brought multiple multi million dollar opportunities to the table i cant win.	company
direction of the company does not appear to be effective moving forward.	company
corrective actions seem impossible in such a large company.	company
product, sales and operations are fully opposed at times, but each is working with leadership direction.	company
"dysfunctional at the regional level  no concern & engagement ""down"" the chain of command from top"	company
a little bit of process improvement required.	company
we must continue to push our investment in technology in order to provide our customers with top notch services and compete in this market.	company
staffing levels need to be increased, or we need to loose accounts.	company
employees who works well & by heart are overloaded, continuously work at home and no week ends - there is no more life.	company
solution for the current problems but not for future	company
management should sincerely consider reimbursing adequately for the fact that we work for two different accounts- boeing & aviall likewise.moreover,the standard of increment should definitely rise,be suitable enough to motivate ourselves perform well	company
management should greatly focus improving our increment structure & bonus	company
hearing out our problems and take corrective measures and action to it	company

computer systems are to slow and delay productivity	company
role profiles need to be developed and training implemented so that people are cross trained on all areas of a specific function	company
inconsistent resources, never ending changes in rate structure and instructions.	company

sales to educate our customers how we are getting the shipments customs cleared and what are the issues we facing when dealling with customs to proceed with the clearances	company
the over aching and continued cost cutting is detrimental to the local business unit.	company

a better buying power from some of our origin offices.	company
too often we lose out to the smaller forwarders (local heroes) because they are able to negotiate better in spite of our size and the volumes we offer to the shipping lines / airlines.	company
we are less nimble than our smaller competitors.	company
a new it system would help.	company
it system, constant screen freezing, system is slow, email is slow.	company
opening large files can be problematic.	company
all we do must comply also with company mission, vision and strategy	company
timely promotion is required.	company
logis system needs to be more integrated	company
we have to deal with so many systems, software & applications in our day-to-day activities in [company].	company
it would be better if [company] can introduce an integrated solutions for all this.	company
i receive the information and communication i need to do my job effectively and i want my direct supervisor keep to leads by example.	company
we don't have transportation monitoring system.	company
i think if we have a system like tms than it will help us more in the work as well as for the customer.	company
processes not tightly controlled  documents/sites not consolidated/organized properly hence leading to confusion and time wastage in searching for the right info	company

it issue, to serve better services and become a no.	company
1 in trade, we have to improve our it , all the top companies are on sap platform , it is easy to download or auto setup reports for there customers on sap platform.	company

[company] need improve it systems, we need to simplify the process once systems and software in to the [company].	company
need one software or systems for all [company] products.	company
supervisor also needs to focus a bit more on the customer needs when an escalation is needed.	company
reinforce people with this information would be great.	company
i had the opportunity to sit across from my air freight manager for a few months and his behavior and attitude towards a few agents was unprofessional.	company
he makes improper jokes about them which led me to wonder what he says about me during my absence	company
i honestly believe that this company focuses to much on it's  kpi's.	company
due to this, employee's have less time to process shipments which causes backlog and delay's.	company
more dg export agent to process dg shipment	company
the biggest issue i see is with the implementation of new customers.	company
majority of new accounts are brought in prior to anyone communicating with the station management before shipments are rolled out creating losses on these shipments for the station.	company
management looking at their employees ideas and suggestions.	company
communication between all departments  training employees  teamwork - no one wants to help one another  respect - no one has much respect for one another.	company
we are in an environment where it appears that we need to scratch and claw for every shipment we can to improve our tonnage and bottom line for our p & l yet we focus so much on making sure we do not manually rate shipments a contradiction to me.	company
my thoughts would be to have senior management interact with immediate managers to see what can be done to help with the customers requests, especially with specific reporting, etc...	company
senior management are not airfreight people .	company
the way shipments are costed , doe in the us is extremely high ...	company
i wrote statements to senior hr with facts, will see...	company

one on one interaction with the employee every month.	company

hr executives are not approachable & don't show any courtesy to respond the mail.	company
pest control to be done on regular basis.	company
[company] is already putting lots of efforts to improve..which is great.	company
every one in team should be counted as resourceful/efficient employee and should be given equal importance and opportunities in order to motivate them.	company
rules are put in place for a reason and there needs to be more consequences if rules are not followed otherwise no one will follow and nothing will change.	company
have been created such as impat, cssv & bpo, etc.. but seems to me it is just an extra layer of work, more people involved and same questions being asked by diff people creating more work.	company
i believe that overall the company is heading in the right direction and trust that the management team will make improvements as needed.	company
the direction of the company keeps changing, and the lack of stability is worrisome.	company
i want to be a problem solver not a follower.	company
greater emphasis on sales to bring in / win new business for air export.	company
i think [company] provides the tools needed to achieve our goals	company
growth and sales efficiency	company
depending on which system and/or country can produce wide variances in results.	company
i find that there many first choice programs rolled out with kpis but not enough resources to carry them on in a station levels.	company
difficult to make any money when product sells too low.	company
allowing resource requirements to be made locally, there is far too much scrutiny on hiring an fte to positively impact business growth and this scrutiny delays the ability to position ourselves to manage business effectively and sustainably.	company
we will need to look at our global bid principles and procedures in order to be more competitive.	company
operations willingness to help and take ownership to resolve issues that are escalated - seems no one has good work ethic anymore.	company
resources are needed to relieve team members in commercial / selling roles from excessive administrative and operational related activities in order to free up more time for selling (new and development)activities.	company
people working in this company for almost more than 4 years-so when senior position opportunity comes, they should be consider 1st.	company
application should get better in sap or oracle.	company
equal opportunities to be given for all the team members to learn new processes coming in within the team/department.	company
priority should be given to work.	company
the points & daily target for which sometimes employees extend or unnecessary errors come.	company
needs to stop.	company
no canteen/no food coup (very dissappointing as we work in a reputed company.no diwali bonus for the employees in gsc mumbai as employees working in india do get the bonus.still obstacles to get a movement in different [company] division(no job movement)	company
as we all sit for more then 8 hrs , there should be physical fitness training very often, also there as a fitness prupose company should encourage to adopt cycle to work.	company

company had improved a lot from the day i had joined	company
cafeteria service needs to be improved as per my views.	company
need to improve on admin related issues like cafeteria, pickup drops, housekeeping issues.	company
everyone should be given equal chance to grow in their career.	company
transport facility needs to be improved.	company
even after many escalations from the team members its neglected.	company
the systems that are in place, make the process too long.	company
ie: ordering of certain supplies/equipment	company
more efficient visibility on my customers shipments without having to go to customer service i.e: logis access	company
sometimes clients say the invoices are not delivered with the shipment.	company
everyday is a continuous improvement	company
please do not use speaker phone while calling customer or co-workers	company
kpi's reflect on what your personal bonus will be at end of the year,therefore other persons/stations or depts may determine whether you receive a bonus or not, this is totally unfair.temp in office horrible.having to wear hat&gloves is ridiculous	company
1.not being sure that you will be permantly employed and placed on the line, have to wait for more than a year to know your fate in the company.	company
all this topic above, to create such a boring vibe, that needs to be improved urgently	company

we require more safey in the work environment, required more space and enough equipment managment need to look in to this	company

procurement is a mess.	company
it is such a long process that needs to be looked at.	company
we waste so much money because of procurement.	company
dimensions of tasks and the quantity of resources to make them need to be improved.	company
it's important to improve communication (an example is the non-informed delay in starting cif) and strategies to improve non-salary benefits need to be created (example: food boxes, which could be monthly).	company
2.focus on our core competency and stop creating more products that duplicates services n resources.	company
there are lack of promotion options especially when limited by budget constraints	company
salary/compensation should not be proposed based on which country someone is coming from.	company
amount of work done sometime is double than peers with much lower compensation which is not fair and demotivating.	company
nothing needs to be improved	company
the way employees are treated because of voicing there opinion in order to better service the customer.	company
it is not as user friendly a it could be to request applications.	company
i would like to see overseas stations be reminded that they work for [company] first the customer second..they are very abusive to their co-workers in the states..when it comes to rates and transit times..they don't understand that we work to make profits.	company
communication/sufficient coverage in the event that an employee is out for a period of time either for leave or vacation/knowledge from leadership to cover a desk if needed/less eos activity emails they bog down a persons inbox	company
really appreciative of what has been improved!	company
several due to finance issues are allow.	company
mine is not.this is  causing me to lose out on helping others while at home.	company
i believe the ability to bring on new hires and add additional resources within a station needs reviewed at a corporate level.	company
we will never be able to get ahead of the game when there are volume influxes due to the current processes and procedures.	company
would like to see a new computer program that incorporates most or all of the products on one platform.	company
there are to many systems and sign on's we need a one point access to all systems.	company
data has to always be cleaned up (manually) before providing to customers.	company
if a new customer is brought onboard our employees don't have the time to service them properly.	company
a long time to get me setup with a computer login and e-mail.	company
we receive 3 reports and week and i believe we are better off serving the customer than continually updating these reports.	company
warehouse needs more people to get everything done right.	company
i don't feel i have enough experience or knowledge in [company] to ascertain what needs to be improved.	company

anything that can help the company to get better	company
too much focus on savings and profitability  employee benefits	company
reporting for the sales team needs to be improved.	company
there are too many variables to select when running reports in isell and logis is very limited.	company
access to monthly trend reports for our sales portfolio would help the sales team manage churn.	company
this will give us a better understanding of their business.	company
leader focused too much on the file counts in the past and needs to understand the complexity at the same time.	company
they should also not take advantage of their position just because they are higher than us.	company
equipment needs to be updated we have some people working with windows 10 while others are still using windows 7, i think in order for our system to flow properly everyone needs to have the same materials and equipment.	company
the computer system needs to be improved in our office.	company
it is very slow at times which slows down our productivity.	company
we could also use bigger monitors for our computers.	company

we need to use more effective softwares to compete with our competitors.	company
no one from my co-workers never been employe of the month.	company
there needs to be consequence for repeat mistakes which cost the company money and loss of service to customers.	company
constantly struggling to complete the work on time due to the limited staff we currently have.	company
maybe too much focus on forecasting.	company
if you win business the first question you are asked if for projection on revenue and margin rather than how is it going to be handled effectively.	company
our sales pipeline and new business wins,we remain woefully weak in this area.	company
too many manual processes and too many different systems that air imports and exports have to use.	company
churn - would be very interested to see how this is being addressed as does not still seem to be documented/communicated to the business as a whole what the strategy is on this & how we are implemented	company
in my opinion, there are no areas that need to be improved.	company
when i log in to my computer it takes almost half an hour for it to login!	company
management and senior management jobs are very often not posted on job watch instead it appears that successors are just chosen without following the proper process	company

better it infra/equipment can be provided.	company
like if any emergency situation exist (flood or any external issue) then enough food should be available.	company
a lot of new unwanted activities are forced which can be avoided.	company
smt or bpo could take a feedback from user on the new things / activities implemented by them.	company
in my assessment there is no needs to be improved.	company
we need to improve our bcp especially in times of calamity.	company
we are not prepared on how to handle calamity such as earthquake	company

if an issue comes up where dispatch is not meeting their needs, [name] and [name]Â do an excellent job helping us help our customers and make them happy.	company

we received clear picture form the senior management for the future and the strategy	company

my workinggroup help one another out.	company
there is no seniorty when it comes to equipment, and that means certain tasks are dished out to minorities and people who dispatch have agreed on hastling and punishing.	company

to contribute to the success of our company every day	company
planning - follow up on planned trucks	company
my direct team is focussed and supportive, while i sense other teams are less likely to cooperate with our department since we have a global overview and highlight/suggest certain changes required in other departments.	company

some things are said to some people , and no communications is very poor.	company
we have been steady with freight.	company
earlier start times seem to help some	company
we have lost our competitive edge in the marketplace.	company
inability to execute the basics of pick-up, delivery and billing  cost cutting to make spreadsheets look good hurts employees and customers	company
paying attention to emails stressing the need to move late or sitting freight.	company
operations needs to understand that we survive and grow only if we put the customer first.	company
on time service and how the local terminals both inbound and outbound react to service failures and freight that has been identified as hot or protected - try to increase focus on this as well as w&i and osd/claims improvements.	company
we should harmonize our processes in freight to be more similar in different countries, f.ex. booking processes , data quality etc.	company

internal communication some times is small problem.'	company
everyone is stretched thin already and it is a struggle to accomplish everything and service both the internal and external customers efficiently.	company
edi booking from consignor.	company
90% of shipments delivered or collected on time is not a good enough for small countries with less shipments.	company
there's still lack of commitment in some departments of the company, we should all have clear that we work for the client and to give the best service, but it seems some people still don't assume it.	company
more clear focus on core products such as ltl and ptl	company
service needs to improve.	company
more use and actions taken when customer feedback is received and overall attitude towards customers is an improvement point.	company
sometimes it is hard to sell our product, because there are some shortages in our network.	company

the management doesn't provide any clear and transparent strategy on how the company is going to be successful.	company
the capacity issue is still making our working days harder and our customers dissapointed.	company
create programs which will inspire and develop the employees.	company
a satisfied employee results to the success of a company.	company

training at my terminal.	company
only negative reinforcement tend to happen.	company

strategy  respect  lead by example	company
people are treated without any respect any more: screaming and shouting towards employees seems to be a popular trend.	company
leadership in freight seems to be completely not in line with the expectation from [name] towards leadership/respect.	company
leadership style of management across different levels and use of new modern techniques to motivate and inspire employees	company
there is no clear vision in which segment to develop  lack of communication between departments  the processes and job descriptions are not defined and implemented	company
to accept eachother as we are, our differences and instead of only point out what is wrong help to develop in a constructive way.	company
should have a team concept and not divide us.	company
you can't develop work based on continuous lying and without respect for the team.	company
the direct leader is not a teamplayer; it lacks on vision, inspiration and motivation  there is a sufficient reason for a great deal of concern	company
im missing: happy customers+ happy colleguas + great results.	company
the penny pinching that occurs now we have 2 very well paid managers is frustrating, as they can't get any new work.	company
they are taken for granted at every step.	company
staffing across the board.	company
still could use another forklift with scale on it in wlo.	company
challenge with quality and products.	company
what is [company]'s plan for the future (quality).	company
i don't feel the smt takes it seriously when they are approached with a concern or issue with something they implemented.	company
aside from my direct manager, most attempts at asking questions or gaining insight go unanswered.	company
leadership has to be more open about ways we are planning to impliment measures needed for freight2020.	company
lead by example.	company
the word respect is an important part in our strategy, we would like to see examples of this coming from our senior management in bonn	company
senior management should lead by example.	company
furthermore they should motivate their employee in a positive way, not by putting pressure forward	company
with the new ceo my fmb member adapted to a more hierarchical leadership style, which i think is sometimes inefficient and not support the passion of the 4 ps on employee's side.	company
people, who work on a topic, should be allowed again to represent it.	company
i cannot understand why the people who were in charge when we went bankrupt are in charge again?	company
replace them all with people who actually want to change and upgrade to newer technology.	company
i don't see [name] as a suitable leader, the couple of times i've seen him, he's dressed like everyday is casuel friday and has his face stuck in his cell phon.	company
we need new ideas and new people in senior management.	company
my morning dispatch does not care about his work or show any active leadership.	company
[name] shows extreme leadership and ready for change for this company!	company
company makes my job harder.	company
hiring family members is unfair to other employees favoritism in covering up accidents and i have seen this happen at my terminal a couple of times.	company
manegment in the morning need to make calls to customers such as farmers job sites home delivers before driver starts his day so contact is made before customer leaves for the day so we don't haul the frt.	company
there is no active leadership [name] does what [name] wants and is not a terminal manager he pushes off all responsibility onto [name].	company
outbound dock in crawfordsville is in need of a better manger,cra tem manger is doing a good job,pay rate to get more drivers plus the vacation time	company
we need new management that understands safety and employee health is the best way to make this company move forward & a management that understands nazi ss storm trooper discipline is not good for employee safety and well being.	company
the company mral is the worst it has ever been	company
we need an executive team that knows how to run a trucking business successfully.	company
our ceo and [name] are running it into the ground.	company
we need to possibly creat a few more terminal locations, to eliminate long peddle runs we currently have and to enhance our product by offering direct service to all of our 5 state area.	company
wages need to be raised safety is a joke the management talks a good game but falls far short of following through.	company
we can't hire good help due to low wages,day dispatch is a joke why is same management that put us thru bankruptcy still here?ð¤	company
sometimes it seems as if [company] has too many plans and projects without considering if the employees have the sufficient time.	company
we should try to focus more to simplify our work.	company
do more to make the drivers to commit to our company, by making a better place for them to work.	company
the company should pay more attention to experienced employees, not to loose loyal and integrated people at one end, and on the other hand to pick up inexperienced street people who are leaving in the trial.	company
the most valuable for the company are satisfied people who work within company.in this case company can go for good results.	company
long decision-making period and high strategy variability	company
more publicitity,more actions when it comes to helping people,and environement.	company
resourcing and support - in particular hr, it, sales, all of which have disappeared since the closure of freight uk.	company
those left have no business infrastructure.	company
project organisation (more time)	company
there is a strategy for 2020 but i think we need more information regarding the developemnt of the areas to improve both in sweden as in other countries.	company
the overall strategy of [company] is well known but a more detailed plan and breakdown for [company] sweden need to get be communicated.	company
with this capacity we cannot grow up and its a chance to loose some of our clients.	company
more clarity on the product portfolio	company
[company] headquarter must group estonia  as scandinavian country.	company
times already changed and estonia is more scandinavia then cheap workforce east europe.	company
quality of service and same conditions everywhere with investment	company
as a compagny we need to stop thinking in small units when it comes to making money.	company
sometimes we dont do reasonable moneymaking buisness becourse people are protecting their litle money portfolio instead of thinking about compagnyas a hole unit.	company
our computer and internet speed needs to be improved to have a productive work enviornment	company
at the moment we are looking at how we can further improve, but this also leads to uncertainties which could lead to good people leaving.	company
management has no clue about the freight business, always comparing to pep.	company
strategy needed to make [company] dk competetive in the market.	company
we have no strategy or vision.	company
remove the stevens point terminal from the jurisdiction of milwaukee terminal and place it back under the dubuque terminal as a parent terminal.	company
allow our terminal to utilize technology locally.	company
how long can we deliver freight 3 days late , and say we give good service	company
what is the plan for standard forwarding.	company
it seems the company is making changes simply to be making changes without the input of the drivers or even first line management.	company
where is std/[company] pay at can we compete?	company
our linehaul is going to have to arrive earlier.	company
we must get out with these peddles earlier.	company
getting the freight to the terminals on time.	company
using the latest technology to pull ahead and stay ahead of our competition.	company
need ,more training on the people net.	company
we have no idea who is running this company anymore either.	company
there is a lot of talk about the next contract which i am worried about.	company
not for my point of view but in some cases the annoucements are to generic for some of the employees	company
update customs and vat  procedures  bepaalde tools inzake export control; denied part screening;  bepaalde tools communicatie w.o webex accounts	company
difficult to understand when the 1st time they tell you to do move a and that this is fixed procedure and the next time it is move b (not acc.	company
to procedure), because you are running out of working time.	company
not always company update in the right way employees concerning changes.	company
you read information that contains a lot of company abbreviations and since you donÂ´t have a clue what itÂ´s about you stop reading and therefore miss our on important information.	company
avoid treating a particuler group of people with preference and making the others feel they are less of a human being and also work on learning and development of workers	company
we need to get are more stable balance between sales and production.	company
before anything can be reality for a new or an existing customer, i think the terms should be cleared with our local freight production and forwarding manager, and the production.	company
we need more information for our daily work.	company
bosses to get off there [profanity] and come on the shop floor and talk and discuss theproblems we have .	company
unfortunately, a lot of information is being retained, thus leading to miscommunication.	company
get a wlo terminal manager that cares about more than just him self, last year my house was flooding and he chewed me out when i called in, he said we have freight to move	company
overall flow of freight lanes and dispatch of p&d runs.	company
i would like to have employee feedback on how i am performing at work.	company
better commuication from mangement about progress of company listen to ideas from people about safety and how to make the company better	company
dispatch needs improvement.	company
and have the freight on time.	company
also relaying issues w equipment	company
promote a culture of open communication to encourage communication and feedback between departments, as well as between management and staff.	company
this will liven up the stream of ideas, resulting in a more productive team overall.	company
acess to information in on board computer	company
eliminate  ramdom  bazar  loose  uncontained  un  secured  not  readey  ry  for  shipment  automatic  friegh t  cliam  damages  g  extreme  time  wasteful  driver  has  more  important  responsabilites	company
follow thru when you say your going to do something do it  the pay rate is well below also	company
are phone system is still very slow somtimes you can be on hold for 10 to 15 min.	company
taking workers advice in consideration.....less micro managing and more listeniung to workers advice towards ways to be more efficient	company
no communication between dispatch and drivers until 3:30 pm for pickups  sometimes weve already been by that customer and could have made the pick up earlier saving time and money	company
p&d dispatch routing needs to be improved to be more efficient and dispatcher should be more open to drivers suggestions on the routing	company
making sure the right freight is loaded and pro #s are correct with the bills	company
in most cases the people making the changes do not take into consideration the employees doing the work.	company
[company] lacks the ability to connect and provide sharing of services across the platforms of its logistics capabilities.	company
the opportunity to expand profit is missed since many customers cannot utilize the access of [company]'s freight across modes and divisions	company
as most of the team players are working alone without sharing the data and the information, it is more than important to provide the feeling of trust on each other.	company
intercompany solutions better coorporation between [company] / supplychain / gerlach customs / global forwarding and freight	company
also, the company doesnât have to make promises to the customers which canât be fulfilled.	company
i think that the work in team has to be improved becouse that company will work better and sucsesfully.	company
we need to make more things outside the company in our team so it's not all about work	company
you should have the opportunity to handle bureaucratic formalities such as requests for leave online.	company
too many different projects/efforts requiring bpm support, being driven by different people/teams/countries, and a general lack of resources to help to support these different projects/efforts, also often with a lack of clarity of responsibilities.	company
also there are only a select few who actually put an effort into trying to make this company and/or terminal better.	company
keep up the good work	company
you make a mistake they hold it agenstlike you are stupid.	company
drivers do what they want on displan that  needs to change	company
a scannning system on the dock area would increase, any possible error on missloads.	company
and for training on loading trailers and moving customers freight so there is less damage going on.	company
for me we have to learn all the systems, programms and tools of the company.	company
better sharing of knowledge and understanding of what other departments are working with.	company
better understanding of functions.	company
more learning about the new technology	company
my opinion is that all of us need some actions in order to improve ourselves.	company
there is a lot of space for improvement for each employee.	company
"there should be more learning materials and maybe a little bit more attention that is given to the new employees so they could ""jump in"" faster and do a better job."	company
need better train a new colleagues.	company
there are a to bad manual with alot of information missing that you recive in email or by mouth to mouth	company
vague and obscure which greatly inhibits personal development.	company
need more investment in people and capabilities	company
we have lost good people to other companies and i don't see that ending.	company
the president does not even live here and seldom engages in any conversation with his employees other than his upper management staff.	company
especially visible right now going into a contract negotiation period.	company
the technical circumstances are often inadequate, the connection to ishare, mynet, etc.	company
is often very slow.	company
the laptops are infinitely slow.	company
the eternal waiting times affect employee motivation and slow down work results, which is certainly more expensive overall than faster laptops.	company
employees should not be the first item where company should save money!	company
i hope we will not have to wait for decades..	company
and better understanding who is doing what in the departments.	company
i thing, the problem is deficit people	company
motivational system needs to be improved.	company
to many policies, instructions, ... more and more, pararlell to eachother what sometimes lead to de motivation and of course al lot of stress	company
this would give extra motivation in my opinion.	company
the systems, we work with too much systems to get the work done.	company
i think there is lack of work power due to increasing volume of goods transported.	company
company disregards this aspect and does not even adjust wages of people directly responsible for operations and dispatching vehicles.	company
i was lead to believe that our performance meant something.	company
"many years of this has lead to ""burnout"" and stress-related health issues."	company
planning of resources for active holiday seasons to avoid stressing overworkload of reduced staff	company
technology material needed to do a great work (computer).	company
i have been told by a member of the smt at we will keep getting busier and busier, and in my team we are already doing too much too fast, if we need to work even faster, we will either need more man-power, or better tools to improve efficiency.	company
employee care  it is impossible to work any faster then we do.	company
if we are asked to do so, it will have catastrophic effects	company
lack of proper resources to successfully complete the large number of projects simultaneously.	company
when resource gaps develop, project prioritization is poor.	company
fire [name], he ran company down first time, and he is at the helm again.	company
telephonica/bt transission gives many technical problems, right now telephone system is not up to date and gives bad performance and leak of service; new system to replace is not yet available due to delays.	company
old printers in house = daily breakdowns.	company
[company] acts better in this way.	company
the performance of the it network (computers are very slow) should be adjusted.	company
get freight to terminals earlier  increase pay to drivers  hire some help	company
i think that vacation time needs more flex ability and i think that management and drivers need to be held to the same standards i.e.	company
when a driver need off early its a struggle but management has no issue at anytime	company
the company needs to hold dead beat accountable for their lack of production.	company
the company also needs more trailors.	company
the greatest fault that i see as a driver is the way we document pick ups by calling them in via phone or manually typing them into the people net.	company
there is tooo much favortism with certain individuals, management has different standards for certain people.	company
there is no disiplene at this company the wages need to come up so we can get better help	company
your commitment to safety, hiring salespeople who will actually visit a [profanity] customer!	company
better phone systems.	company
driver pay and compensation needs to be addressed desperately.	company
investments in human resources needs to be a top priority.	company
[name] is very mean.	company
when a driver has a problem.	company
he likes to argue and  cause more problems.	company
[name] and [name] are good  dispatchers.	company
on going issues with service and follow up	company
we as whole agheera we need to be little more process oriented.	company
we continue to come up with new ideas but the programs and sops that have been put in place so far this year are creating more manual work than ever.	company
we also suffer from a lacking it-structure: old/poorly designed tools, server capacity problems and alike.	company
"we need to improve programs and softver for ""no read"" parcels, we use old programs and they are much more complicated... with improvment will be much more easy to work on thet part of job..."	company
more feedback needed in terms of personal development  standardization of processed	company
we need lighter and more flexible processes in terms of hr	company
leadership must listen to employees and our problems.	company
we did nothing to improve since last eos and we do not get the right info, or training we must have in order to do our jobs better.	company
there is always space for improvement such as reducing the mistakes regarding my area and possition, by trying deferent methods and see what could be more efficient	company
reaction, reply, updates, correct info from other terminals	company
one single database for business as a single depository and source of data	company
continuous improvement and growth of the company.more clients to come and stay satisfied.the company is yet to offer a lot of services and we are open to new horizons.	company
my opinion is that we have to improve our euroconnect groupage.	company
our transit time is not really good and this is the reason that our clients refuse to arrange transports with [company].	company
maybe we need a new strategy.	company
[company] doesnt take any actions on previous eos s.	company
intercompany and inter-business unit cooperation.	company
agheera needs to improve.	company
making more use of e-plato.	company
we need to focus on customers expectations and not divide into departments but see it as a whole and act that way.	company
it is very important to keep up with the market changes.	company
it is just fine for now, but as a reminder, we need to keep improving ourselves.	company
no unifined erp system: different systems for ops, finance, sales.	company
shipments data and revenue doesnt reflect in  crm.	company
systems need to be proving efficient for undertaking increased amounts of volume in traffic.we need to have systems in place before brexit and use this as the transition period now.if we can streamline our services and systems now,we will be ready.	company
technology needs to continue to improve.	company
for the south bend terminal we need to fix the arrival times in the morning so we can get the freight delivered and the customers taken care of	company
improve use of infotechnology side of warehouse programs.what suprised me most,when starting to work in [company],external programs are still used,which in it era still includes alot of paperwork and registration of new goods is  not timely effective.	company
we need to improve from the technical and digital point of view	company
we really need a new inventory management system	company
we need to improve in monitoring improvements.	company
not starting projects and new processes but forget about checking what have been the results.	company
all performance data presented  must have targets clearly shown and ideally some history of recent progress made.	company
just stating a percentage in isolation misleads.	company
faster implementation and change of freight soft	company
the c4c system we work in is not stabile (speed/break downs/icare handling etc.)	company
- this is frustating to have the feeling of being able to perform better and faster, but getting slowed down by a system.	company
the freight network still needs to have a quality lift, so hope the progress seen with eurapid will follow with a complete general lift.	company
"and look at the cost for full load production, despatching could take place from ""low cost"" areas/countries."	company
timely information and handheld scanning equipment to speed up pickups	company
[name] needs to go he is part of the problem not the solution he is one of the major reason for the hateful disrepectful culturearound here	company
too short for truck/trailer to both fit with doors down.	company
i think that the company should take our suggestions and ideas into consideration in the process of improving the quality of our company.	company
get hand held devices/app that we can use with our smart phones that would turn our phones into handhelds.	company
get rid of as many cell phones as you can & offer employees that are willing to use their own cell phones a monthly bonus towards our own bill	company
need bigger terminal for the volume of freight we move	company
linehaul linehaul linehaul how many times do we need to tell you people?	company
as a company we are so far behind our competition in technology and equipment.	company
i know that [company] bought into this problem when they purchased us.	company
even with the changes that have been made, we still need to catch up to even our worst competitor.	company
hand paperwork on the dock 98is a pain.	company
people net could use improvement	company
we only get information from her we don't see anyone else at our terminal.	company
teach strap usage.	company
better salespeople for the smaller terminals better communication for upper management	company
sales team,old management,we need a fresh eyes,fresh ideas new sales team	company
holding operations responsible for their actions that lead to lost business and makes it harder to hit our goals that are very lofty.	company
"otherwise, we don't live up to the claim of being an ""employer of choice"" and the company's success is greatly impeded, too."	company
there are certain times that i feel like as a whole our company does to much micro-managing.	company
at times that is necessary but sometimes it does more harm than good.	company
we need to be better at providing the clients with feedback.	company
too many to list.	company
i do not like to be asked to give my input, when my input goes right out the window any other day of the year.	company
operations nightmare, service is the worst i have ever seen.	company
little to no response from my terminal with operations issues.	company
web tracing needs to improve.	company
when customers trace on the web it's not giving them the correct information.	company
we need better linehaul better connections better transit times than we could have satisfied customers and less complaints so we could work better and get more clients not to loose them....also network connection is bad if computers would be faster..	company
we need maybe better hardware (new pc) and internet connection to work faster	company
software we use should be easier to use and get reports, maybe we need a training to use it properly.	company
cooperation between branches and responsibility for other branch shipment same as for own clients.	company
recently a dubuque driver was allowed to leave our terminal at 530am with an empty trailer to go to east moline to layout in a motel in order to get more money and layout pay.	company
i rhink that we need to improve administration.	company
i think that we are evolving very slowly in this area	company
network cooperation between country	company
full awareness of what every individual action means in our customer's supply chain	company
we struggle with software and hardware issues.	company
the overall [company] systems and tools should be improved.	company
you need to give a bigger financial motivation to the people.	company
the work environment needs to be improved.	company
better mobile phones.	company
it applications - finance and operating  structured approach	company
it will not make happy.	company
it platforms (booking, warehouse and so on)	company
we continue to take on more work/projects than our resources and technology can handle.	company
i'd like to be more proactive in adding these recourses at the onset of a project to avoid the extra work involved with backlogs and customer/vendor disatisfacti	company
in my team, there are no clear and stable job definitions and no clear targets.	company
people need to be praised for good work / power has to get back to countries to effectively plan resources acc to biz needs.	company
bila support to develop business has to be re established for effective tradelane development / wms requires development	company
as a division we need to work more closely togetehr to move towards standard ways of working and ensure effecicncy fr all and ot stay wiht the local pockets of how to do things	company
i don't want to give any feedback.	company
we need easier access to mail via mobile phone and also roaming in foreign countries must be a minimum in 2017!!!	company
could use more drivers to help with the freight increase.	company
never improve anything here.	company
we could use some more drivers to help make our job more efficient	company
everything the senior management is a joke i have never worked for a group of disrespectful and incompetent individuals in my career i have never had a terminal manager use such profanity at me before doing any fact finding very unprofessional.	company
every employee steals time.	company
driver hiring  communication  when we call over and get n return calls from payroll  overworking everyone some weeks r terrible need more money for the job we do	company

some department no left after 4:30 pm.	company
not this survey, its a waste of time and out dated, maybe if we truly listened to the employee that maybe a start, but having this tailored survey just ticks boxes and in fact enrages people: make a decision is this optional or mandatory	company
communication with all level e.i [company] uk insight call for all staff.	company
hearing the voice of the employee through yellow box, coffee and donut and other session that gives opportunity to the employee to voice out our feedback.	company

shuttle services provide by company.	company
some department they don't swipe when come in & out of the office  , all we are employee at [company] , should be treated all same even from safety prospective .	company
the lunch is quite good	company
the hr department is doing the grate job.	company
great office, and facilities	company
the office is a lovely space to work in.	company
loosing business in the name of cost control by every one.	company
new business for the office, encouraging people to think outside the box.	company
the inter-company relationships between stations (p&ls) must be improved as well.	company
less ocean timestamps akin to airfreight.focus on customers,not stats.make this box bigger.250 chars not enough.	company
sales sales sales  stop spending as much time looking inwards and spend the time looking at our clients needs.	company
quality vs quantity or being proactive vs reactive.	company
amount of work in 1 person.	company
(please refrain from using peopleâs names or language that m	company
all of which costs us money.	company
we also don't have an it tool that can cover the needs of clients who are between the bc and mnc.	company
better website for as credit card customers always complain it doesn't explain what we do.	company
sales team gives us requests that they don't know we can't do.	company
we need to have spoc with ops and cs capabities...it wll surely support to acheive happy customers	company
it will improve our service level automatically & save our valuable time & manpower.	company
examples, providing transport for pick up and drop off staff.	company
uk would benefit from stability in the overall company structure.	company
if any of them were to close down or to leave us, we would be in a major crisis	company
warehouse operation  working time â there are lot of accounts which required 24hrs operation but currently only 2 shifts are running & because of that operation is overloaded sometime.	company
1) customer service - the current approach is simply not working as it needs too  2) bc client focus - we are still very much focused on mnc/csi client base, and are thus neglecting bc clients daily, we are not staffed to be able to manage bc clients	company
quotation retention in logis and cmr need to be followed up and to be updated at all times to ensure accuracy and speed	company
corporate [company] spends too much money on advertising in sporting events	company
the speed of emails and 1 or 2 systems rather than 5 different systems.	company
however, i don't think this can be achieved by having the offshore team to do some of the tasks that could have been done better locally.	company
not need for acc and occ in the current form as this was more applicable during nfe.	company
we spend too much time internally in meetings - need to be in front of customers	company
quote turn a round time, it takes up to three days to give a customer a quote, i lose a lot of business because of this.	company
when we have people away in ssu & csu our response times to customers are too slow & in turn we miss out on business.	company
experienced staff - confidence to deal with issues when they arise or simply pick up the phone & discuss with kam	company
it's hard to be cost focused when no one but senior managers have p&l access.	company
bc account the small customer that we are not processing frt in time.	company
(don't train me for a day and let me be make sure we are good) all the tools must be giving.	company
most common theme of ccm - we don't answer emails/calls.	company
"""no skin in the game"".others do more(inc sales)to keep the cust."	company
most at desk level don't care if we lose an acct or shipment.	company
much of my time as a salesperson is filled up with operational issues when the ops team should be handling the issues.	company
i'm not sure if the ops team isn't trained in customer service and dealing with issues, but it falls in the lap of sales people.	company
service on ocean fcl and lcl, especially for states that are in the middle of the us, feels like they are forgotten by hub stations.	company
we constantly swing between wanting more files/vol vs gp.	company
customer service within some key stations.	company
too many customer issues now that cs and ops are combined.	company
unfortunately everyone didn't received this message, because we are still facing lot of errors in basic doing and this affects to our custo	company
pls note still focus on customer centricity & quality missing even after having gccs & oe & customer meetings we are just getting e-mails on daily basis with numbers but real action plan & serious corrective actions missing to avoid losing customers.	company
too much bureaucracy & reporting	company
[company] is overly focused on internal improvements and kpi's pd's etc.	company
too much time and emphasis spent on oi's and pd's, often detracts from actually servicing the customer.	company
need to work on rate and space issue for which we lost the business regularly & we losing our face in front of customer.	company
need additional choice of vendors, liners, etc  3.	company
cs quality differs depending on staff.	company
providing jp reporting team with 64-bit, 16.00 gb desktop pcs with power bi as well as 32-bit 4.00 gb laptops	company
sometimes it is observed that many things are done just to meet the kpi by cs & ops team.	company
ops will not issue a credit note to the customer even if it is approved because of kpi even if it effects customer relationship.	company
though we talk lot of things about customer focused, it doesn't really translate at the ground level.	company
is working to make their dept.	company
customers are expecting only person needs to be interacted with them, [company] representative should handle cs, ops and cbc activities.	company
- vas - isc, llp , control tower, .	company
csi performance is measured not only by the revenue generated but also the gp/ebit impact on p&l.	company
i think we are stepping back and looking more inside than outside, and our customer are out there waiting to	company
=> loosing customer one after another but there is no quality drive actually to gain new customer  => be more customer centric to retain existing customer  => employee turnover rate is very high  => need to improve at grading & salary benchmark	company
we need to work as 1 team & adapt to requests.	company
evening snacks should be available in canteen.	company
snacks service should be provided in cafeteria.	company
transport facility for girls should be done properly.	company
on the us dom side, we need ops staff w/dom frt forwarding backgrounds, mentality, creativity, & passion.	company
doesn't mean they aren't good people, they just don't possess the skill set needed to compete.	company
we need to operate more as a network of stations, countries, and regions.	company
today we tend to only think locally, and do what is right for our local p&l.	company
customer response at the station level.	company
two main items:  1.	company
for example, if a customer ships to/from multiple stations in the u.s., the customer service should be centralized.	company
canteen facility for all shifts	company
we need to do more with what we have for our customers on a more consistent basis.	company
improvement of our daily computer world.	company
cooperating with eu / us office  they almost focus his control biz, but not pay enough attention about control not belong their biz.	company
cs is very inefficient leading to customer dissatisfaction.	company
1) service centric approach amongst cs, operations.	company
2) products must improve buying rates for better gp.	company
cs and ops should have more accountability and we need more fresh blood to have high enthusiasm at work place.	company
a rate quote for instance can take several days whereas other companies in the industry can provide one within hours.	company
they would know the equipment in area and as well as services required for a customer.	company
the right ppl+right jobs+right # of ee, we'll increase profits.	company
[name] je presprilisna a neodmenovana, coz je demotivujici.	company
we just don't seem to be able to get the simple things right.	company
in 2017, we (especially products) really don't seem to be concerned about the customer & maybe we are using wrong strategy to improve the ebit by taking customers for granted wrt services & rate increase.	company
if we are closing down telesales, how are we able to serve the smaller customers better when our priority says grow bc?	company
the head office in bonn to be closer connected to the customer experience from a service view point transit  a better understanding by bonn on how inefficient the systems are and time consuming so this is eating into available time to fulfil requests	company
(very) poor processes/it systems, not supporting daily life	company
mid term face to face reviews for another.	company
 there is way too much work vs.	company
 we spend time on tasks that we should not   we live in semi-controlled chaos	company
we have finally got new staff but its been too late.	company
there doesn't seem to be any thanks.	company
i feel as if the employee opinion survey is mandatory when we are told that it is voluntary.	company
more staff to cover for sickness and holidays and training	company
i haven't been here for long yet, so i can't judge.	company
we also need 2 days weekend e.g.	company
prayer & ablution room required at dafz.in dafz we don't have staff canteen.bird drops is damaging the shipment & creating health issues for us.there is no air circulation inside the toilet.warehouse has to be airconditioned.	company
quality of safety shoes need to be incresed.	company
winter jacket required warehouse staffs who are working outside.	company

increase man power for looseshipment handling.staffs are using allergic & asthma sprays due to bird drops inside the warehouse.winter jackets required for warehouse staffs who are working outside.	company
winter jacket to be provide to all staffs who are working outside.locks has to be changed & fixed for saftey lockers @ changing room.canteen required for all staffs at dafz.02days weekly off required for all warehouse staffs.	company
winter jacket was promised on last eos but still not received.uneven flooring of the warehouse has not been repaired.	company
we need strong and efectve ledership,tra aed250 but didect300.	company
sir now in dubai house rent increase everywhere so need to increse our accomodation allowences	company
better overtime pay and 2 days off for warehouse staff.	company
employees under probation period can have paid sick leave also in an emergency case.	company
as we are working in a busy account and work in warehouse is physically demanding, we should have at least 2 days off per week same as the staff in offices.	company
week end off for warehouse staff to be reviewed	company
s  system and excel we till waiting for twodays off floor  hays also	company
like to sugges weekly two days off for the floor staff.other wise we can increase our duty time by one hour 6 days in week(8am to 6pm)if do this according to my knowledge company will not get any loss.also sugges free transportation & accommadation.	company
and all staff two days off .	company
annual leave friday not to be counted	company
evry yer need to angrryment and bounes becouse dubai leaving coust like room rent and food is very hight price and overtime food annaunce aed 10 is not enught.	company
i think i've had one pay increase in about 10 years	company
employee requests not entertained:shorter lunch/early finish time, flexible hours.	company
this use to be an enjoyable place to work, that has had a complete turnaround over the last 12 months.	company
having worked here since last october, i have seen a change in atmosphere within the office in the recent months.	company
new people who don't know what they are doing get in positions and have no clue about the customers they have.	company
some staff in the office moan about w/h so w/h do not want to join in on certain events because of the office staff as they don't want to spend time with them	company
i don't feel we interact as well as we could with other departments.	company
cafeteria should be improve, as in night shift there is nothing to eat in vending machine.	company

recreation facilities not available in our work place.	company
office space needs to be reviewed and assessed for better	company
maybe to conduct more employer surveys.	company
initial matches to be conducted in previous three week end.	company
office work timing-7.30to4.30	company
check the possibility of every six month's issuance of safety shoes.	company
1.everyone taking breaks but admin staffs working only 5 days on the contrary warehouse staffs work 6 days;  2.bonus and increment should be every year.	company
honest hr policy / rcs grading.	company
if we can - it is good to have wearing a smart attire that reflects [company] logo.	company
when people resign it take to long to get replacement	company
in dwc air freight office there should be equal ratio between male and female.	company
also the excess hrs we need stay in the company in order to achieve the target/kpi, whoever exceed 9hrs should be compensated.	company
as i had also stated in last years survey...	company
the improvements from the survey needed to be worked on and communicated sooner in the year and not just a couple of months before the survey comes out again.	company
why osv doesn't have a chance to fill eos, they actually [company] employee too and deserve to share their feeling about working in [company].	company
we working in one of a hub and have same kpi to achieve compare with other hub, however we have more job files compare to other hub, so possibility to have failure is very high, so it's not fair if have a mistake, bonus and increment will burn.	company
complete shirt with the safety vest - example [company]  shirt	company
leaving work place at 5.30 doesn't mean that we're working less compared with team members.	company
requires continuous team bonding on regular basis as a whole department.	company
suggest nr of medical claim of tcm can combine with gp to count, 5th per year are too less.	company
part of management team doesn't even show up... a lot.	company
people get more responsibilities handed to them, and the increase in pay comes a year after or even later of having been promoted.	company
the station, (not my dept), needs to focus their energy on more worthy issues.	company
team building activities with other dept	company
if you are an a1 but have all of the qualifications and are doing the job of an a2 they should be given the title and pay increase if applicable.	company
communication with the customer on regular basis is essential.	company
the amount of rubbish still sitting around areas	company
some support system for those working long hours on a regular basis	company
people are very busy.	company
hr and administrative management need to be improved.	company
impat should be quick and less bureaucratic.	company
should be less layers with 1 manager, 1 team leader and rest operators.	company
pd's help at a dept level with engagement and discussion.	company
management could be more strict on people arriving late / leaving early who are not giving 100%	company
some with birthday celebrations, team building/dinner sessions but for not all departments.	company

we need to motivate our operations dept.	company
my morale is good, but just walking around the station you don't notice a high level of energy that use to be present.	company
please consider all employee equal.	company
since transport arrangement is not yet implemented, i suggest company can arrange it instead of accommodation which will not be effective since we have all different cultures  benches in locker room where after duty one can rest and spend free time	company
better pay rises instead of the default 2% year after year.	company
casual attire for employees.	company
work overload, 1 person responsible more than 5 roles	company

people should only be allowed to smoke on their breaks only	company
i feel hr should be more present in our station.	company
transport facility  and canteen facility should be imrpoved	company
pick and drop facilities should be centralized instead of vikhroli stn.	company
most of the company provide pick up and drop facilities centralised.	company
evening breakfast or snacks should be started  the increment should to be provided to the employees not only by seeing the productivity but also by seeing the effects which they do in extra work .	company
gym facility reqd.	company

company should start providing home pickups and drops in a larger window and both male and female employees should be provided the same window for pickup and drops.	company
centralized pickup and drops should start from more stations.	company
trucks for pick up/delivery.	company
employees need to be more social in office floor.	company
management don't know how to take care of their employees.	company
we have 5 calibers left the company during the last two months.	company

all 4 bus to align common office functions eg hr, finance.	company
haven't received first choice in a few years now.communication between different departments.	company
a bit of support from top management would be very positive for our station.	company
our station is excited to be successful and busy in the future days to come.	company
i will only do so much outside of the office  ex: (flag/poster, box, decorations, and food)	company
i think having a pd board is a good thing but having it everyday the info.	company
less spending money on cst's and internal meetings.	company
station level promotion e.g., my station manager brings in local grown fruits and sweets, places them around the station & encourages to take a break & respond to eos while enjoying what is brought in for us.	company
in our branch it is always the same people who take intiatives while the rest of the staff sits back and remains quiet.	company
food counters should be started at the [company] cafeteria with multiple options to eat.	company
the set up of achievable targets at the beginning of the year instead of past mid year.	company

people that are leading this company need to be more engaged with day to day stuff.	company
i wish i could answer this question, unfortunately with only 250 characters i can't do so fully and with respect to what i wish to say.	company
leadership has no regards for personal time, vacations or workload.	company
this organization can't thrive under a culture of terror.	company
we don't work like any other branch as our work is more complicated	company
"i have been requesting assistance in my role for months the job files have increased over the last six months but always seems to land on ""deaf ears"" i would like someone in leadership sit and do my job for a few weeks, they may then understand."	company
as part of their idp managers should spend a minimum of 2 weeks a year 'back to the floor' doing the job and understanding what is involved.	company
this survey is all about our previous manager...	company
i feel embarrassed when speaking to customers on phone but colleagues in same office are shouting, swearing, singing.	company
the management won't recognize the job you do (will it even see it?).	company
i need more visibility from my top management (n+3 n+4)even if i am confident in [company] in my station i am not sure that my branch manager had the neccesary support from the top management(france and europe) to let our branch become the best one.	company
when hiring, clear assessment so we don't have to fire few months after.	company
in govt firms while staffs are taking annual leave they are applying only for 22days 8 days is calculated as week offs we need to follow same pattern.for the last few years we wrote for new vehilces but when the vehicle came we are thrown out.	company
winter jacket has to be provided.	company

i am joined in this company nine years ago but my salary is very low.some people joined three years ago in this company .	company
please stop challenging productivity and start supporting.	company
there is an air of  mayhem in the office.	company
wages need improving  we need new chairs we have been sitting on the same chair every day for over 7 years.	company
attend pd's & show they support & understand the challenges they face at desk level.	company
it's unfair to expect one person to fully cover another's desk when they are away, as staff are already stressed and under pressure it's virtually impossible to run 2 desks at the one time and there should be a better system in place to cover time of	company
we need to empower sales to get the gp of our top customers	company
the senior management has a very harsh approach.very demotivating and rude.we get unnecessary pressure.managers doesn't like sharing there knowledge.there are many things we could learn but they doesn't share their knowledge& experiences.	company
lack of transport facilities when staying late,  reluctant to pay for overtime.	company
but don't feel its happening.	company
ocean man team, are miles away from the standards [company] are known for and try to achieve.	company
-hayes car parking situation unacceptable - there should at least be a shuttle bus between the overflow and the office.	company
we need weekly two days off& free transportation  we need work station ac/ as as a manger at list say good morning but we are not suppose receive from him.	company
expect more transparency from our management level and hr on the selection and promotion process.	company
respect team /no partiality  over time for who works during holidays	company
i am in cdz deptt and here mnagr [name] and sprvsr [name] [name] they actually doesn't deserve the position they doesn't even know how to manage people, their behavior with employs is not at all good we are working here under tremendous pressure.	company
stations that struggle with their kpi's; there needs to be a team that goes into those stations and help.	company
there shouldn't be weekly conference calls with that station, for then to go over last weeks reports.	company
except my previous cfo, ofr prod, security & cs head.	company
employee moral continues to decline year after year.	company
employee opinion survey, and the results don't count.	company
i feel like hard work and dedication don't matter here.	company
don't always scold us and say if we can't do it correctly we will lose the business!	company
so happy the toilet have upgraded.	company
i believe the pd is a good start on communication.	company
transportation was centralised except in dxb,in dxb sic are preparing trucksheets & executing deliveries.trucking is not responding on weekends & warehousestaffs are doing entire trucking actitivity.quality of the safety shoes has to be improved.	company
quality of the safety shoes need to be improved & distribute the same twice/year.long service award has to be distributed to those staffs who have completed more than five years.winter jackets to be distributed for staffs working outside.	company
the overall work environment and morale continues to go down, the answer is not to push supervisors to find miracle ways, it is building trust and walking the walk.	company
no raises but we're expected to work 7 days a week due to little staffing.	company
hr needs improve efficiency to ensure candidates are available for interview and selection.	company
a task which would normally take 20 minutes becomes a huge ordeal.	company
supervisors don't lead by example, never show up to work.	company
supervisor and manager don't know how to do something so they leave it to you to figure out and you get no help, they walk away from your desk.	company
warehouse needs to be improved.	company
we need a bigger office	company
this is prohibited yet bpo & csu can get replacements.	company
leadership has to be more independent & have to have strategy to rise up when regular business pattern goes wrong.	company
as a ordinary employee, we don't see such skillful strategically sound leadership exists.	company
walk the talk; plan the work and work the plan; obviously the main thing that is lack in my department.	company
leaders are not bothered whether employee stay or leave.	company
given work load as per equability ..don't saw the quantity  check the requirement of customer ...	company
my direct manager doesn't do anything.	company
the management really need to understand process, instead of just moving people from position to position when the process doesn't work.	company
and the process doesn't work because people need to be educate about the terms and procedures in this industry	company
we need single day vacations (as our contract provides for).	company
i have even take this to hr without any resolution.	company
i don't see any thing positive.	company
sr vp leadership in the region i work.	company
the leadership because team leaders are professionals but they don't know how to manage the staff in a good way as leaders but as bosses, they limit the employee's professional development, they don't share all their knowledge and don't motivate to grow professionally.	company
i think that the leadership should be greatly questioned on several levels as i don't feel that my personal well being is in the interest of the company.	company
lately i've felt that the company doesn't care about the workers at all.	company
clear direction and not changing frequently like gp or volume driven.	company
improve gp is not only increase rates and charges, we do need to buy better, creativity to create new prod	company
and company in general i don't trust.	company
what need to improve is the attitudes of managers & superviors.	company
leadship is badly lacking, supervior is never  here at the work place due to all the meetings that go on.	company
even though we don't depend on them much, its nice to know someone's got our back.	company
the dept manager should manage herself firstly.	company
i think supervisors and managers are doing too much desk level work and just don't have the staff or resources (not sure which or maybe both)2 dedicate	company
us smt: engage vs.	company
tell, delegate involvement in solutions vs.	company
this is apparent with my direct communication with ops.	company
no food in cafeteria  different counters of food needed in office premises  washrooms equipment's are not repaired on time  som should be provided to deserving candidate (not to carom champions or shopping mall visiting members..	company
tl & managers must have a good knowledge of the process.	company
sales management can be less busy for the direct reports and spend more time on their development	company
the letter from hr on august 2 to female employees to address dress code was offensive.	company
it also implies that the gender of a manager dictates whether they will address an issue in their dept.	company
should give perfect attendance awards to those staff without any tardiness and sick leaves taken in a monthly, quarterly or yearly basisto havethem motivated and set goals in their mind toeliminate absence's and sick leaves, issuegoodqualitysafeshoe	company
manpower required in ardiya stores,hr needs to look into the health and safety of warehouse dept	company
cleaning crew.	company
dm is bias, does not listen to anyone else's issue except for one person that he wants to make a manager over operations all other employees have said they won't work w/him.	company
we lose at least 1 to 2 employees per month.	company
managers get involved in what they don't know which causes chaos.	company
sr management needs to rebuild trust.	company
as per mu experience , my team leader has no motivation at all , she don't even say good morning to her team, she wont even ask how's the team doing during weekends shift.	company
the efficiency in the whole station is not good enough.	company
too many desks have too little work to fill in the whole 8-hour workday.	company
we have lost our way as a company a strong message from the sr. managers is needed.	company
col increase of 1-1.5% is not realistic.	company
too many changes in the organization of the hr department.	company
people need to be more aware of what they are doing, pickers and checkers.	company
issues treated with indifference by hr when asked for help.	company
the managers all need to create real change and effective engaging leadership so we don't just have the illusion of moving forward.	company
the planning of work activities leaves a lot to be desired.	company
agile doesn't mean disorganized.	company
1)mid term and yearly reviews not conducting on time.	company
need to improve the attitude and behavior of the l&d head.	company
1- management should be more close to operations.	company
strategy &  intitives are very clear to improve gp levels but some deparmentâs  ( e.g.	company
inland logistics dept) lack of leadership/direction  has decome obstacle to achieve targets/improve productivity.	company
company strategy is difficult to relate it to our day to day mission	company
we need to make changes to how the dept is managed.	company
we need also a longer term vision, only cost cutting won't help...	company
proper and articulate overtime pay .	company
also they don't have two days off.	company
because company not think about floor people.	company
every facility is for only office staff.	company
if company giving two days off it will effected for radius seek leave.	company
our uniform quality is very bad.increase our food alavanc	company
if we save on an ongoing basis; where and when will be the time to re-invest in people, skills, offer add'l opp's	company
we need our company one like floor staff they have only one off only friday office staff have two days ...	company
please change our uniform pant color	company
that one day off for the warehouse staff should be implement.	company
1.free transportion facility  2.1 day additional off in a month for a employee who works in the floor	company
two days off in a week.	company
floor staff work very hard so we are weekely two days off.	company
i wise that if transportation is provided by company we will be arrive in time in home due to of outside transport there is no rule so some time we are late.	company
they have two days off its good for them.	company
if company giving two days for admin,then company why not giving for floor people.	company
if company give two days for floor people its effected form seak leave less.	company
plz we need free transport.and in the week give 2 days off...	company
and give quality shoes....	company
and plz i want bonus	company
our safety shoes has too hard and heavy weight , so please provide good and weight less safety shoes.	company
we need weekly 2 days off.	company
- different departments don't cooperate/chase the same goal  - no clear strategy	company
unnecessary time loss because every country is just busy with their own p&l and the total picture is completely out of sight.	company
if possible in future we should have our own premises where we fit right from the gate, parking and office sitting area instead of being hosted by a landlord who has rules that are not friendly to this business.	company
3: 2 days off in week warehouse people doing physical hard work so its must for staff health.	company
warehouse in charges uniform need to change from t-shirt to formal shirt(mangers and supervisors are not wearing company's uniform shirt, the same can provide them.	company
need to work on keeping this place clean as in the bathrooms break room the carpet floors and trash empty every night and water stains this place could really look nice...	company
so, i don't have idea about what needs to be improved.	company
we don't know who to follow.	company
there has been a lot of changes from last year till now.	company
kpi measurment in gateway station need to be reviewed .	company
when it comes to bonus payment or increment we as gateway staff  stand a bigger not to qualify due to  the bigger volume we handle compared to other station	company
working environment must be improved  warehouse to small (congested)	company
as a warehouse worker ,company need to think when the warehouse congested and had to work outside.	company
we are short staffed for the amount of work.	company
adding of monitors within warehouse main door area instead of posters to indicate and show what's right and wrong before entering into warehouse.	company
cs staff travelling from shj are investing nearly 3 hours a day travelling to jafza where as it will be great if management can accommodate them in the dafza facility.	company
instead of reducing staff, we should focus on reducing useless expenses such as promo material for internal campaigns (mouse mats, hats, t-shirts) which are a waste of money and resources.	company
filter out the driftwood in management	company
kpi on c/notes, admin error shld not be calc,  eg: under billed instead of cr and redo, add inv raised, as 2 scared to fail kpi!	company
operation departments  such as cartage cdz require more people in team .operations cartage  cdz is most important  department they  communicate  a  lot more with  clients ) .	company
we should look into more easy and reliable & advance it system for operational & finance, which will be easy to understand & getting mis reporting.	company
which will also maintain quality & service & avoid rework.	company
but, i don't think there is truly alignment in the very top level people.	company
more common sense & more local control of freight & less corporate centralized control	company
need to reopen local station to truly grow my territory.	company
we get too many new initiatives too often and don't have time to follow through on each.	company
since joining the scm team 2.5 years ago, there have been many voluntary and in voluntary cut backs.	company
kindly more concern about the future of each & every employee..	company
each & every employee is thinking about their future & growth of company.	company
if we need to stay back doesn't matter for any reason, compensation should be given in the shape of overtime or day off.	company
"job security (every day at least one time hearing this word from supervisor, ""sales down so any time will lose your job"") psychologically fall down the energy for the worker."	company
i think our work is not being measured or seen as it really is, they base it on a very flat tool for such end and don't see beyond what is really being done.	company
we need to decrease employee turover, as for our  small department it has big influence ( no vacation, no option for illness, overtime etc)	company
rates from asia to europe, especially china.	company
i don't think how our procurement is working is the best way to do it.	company
also we have a salesperson, who spends the time reading the paper instead of getting new customers.	company
since nfe org alignment, imp & exp departments are divided to much.	company
cs: customers come on the 3rdt.. place instead of 1st?	company
need extra sls, cs and ops staff to manage the growing business with us today.	company
settings of targets if possible to be done before the starts of the year instead of doing it almost middle of the year.	company
certain processes are lengthy and time consuming.	company
suggest offering extra 1 day birthday leave to staff	company
working hours more flexible  -may be working hours on 09:30 or 08:30	company
international, air vs.	company
appreciations will encourage & motivate for working in same company &will make the future bright	company
we lost our way on this years ago, and we need to keep working our back to that.	company
no re-investment into domestic in the almost 10 years i have worked here.	company
we are the most profitable product gp per file yet we are the most unsupported	company
this doesn't provide confidence to our people.	company
we still don't give our ideas time to mature and make the impact we believe they will.	company
we 'plan and talk' too much and don't 'action' enough.	company
good food facilities should provided to the employees.	company
1.basic facilities like meal coupons should be started for breakfast and lunch/dinner should be provided in office premises itself.	company
2.centralised transportation (shuttle) should be started	company
facility to male employees regarding drops after 10 pm shift should be provide.	company
2.24x7 food should be available in canteen.	company
please need to check on that.	company
we as a company we need to increase our focus on gp along with the volume .	company
communication with the drivers before they back up to a dock.	company
meaning time consuming.	company
need to provide more space as well equipment such as forklifts and scanners.	company
when a way doesn't work.	company
the stations should have the same clear reporting line and work on the same directive - we both need to be aligned and it must come from top	company
we could always use more bodies, kpi's don't tell the whole story.	company
our corp accts are very time consuming/require significant cust svc.	company
a lot of things, as a desk level employee i don't feel like i am empowered or have any growth in my career with [company].	company
probably the timing of the activities to show that it is genuine and consistent not just we are having the survey and etc.	company
i haven't been here long enough to suggest anything.	company
i think we haven't found the right path yet when it comes to future and strategy.	company
i don't know if they are satisfied with my performance...	company
more integration between asm global (work with ap&am)	company
communication from network ops	company
nathing.b coz stiil nt getting weekly two days off.	company
please tell us what is working well.	company
all managers/supervisors should lead by example & not treat employees with attitude; do not bring your home problems to the work place, do not raise your voice in the office...	company
this isn't for ssa but for the whole network.	company
please no cascade souvenir delivery.	company
it is hard to get a hold of hr and when we do.	company
it would be great to have a local hr that we can talk to in person.	company
refer to guideline, when government announced the bad weather signal, branch manager need to advise whether we need to go to work.	company
in reality, we can't get any info from branch manager.	company
there is no set bar across the floor that everyone is held to.	company
proper documentation about travelling and please give everyone a chance/opportunity to support other country.	company
no man is an island.	company
communication...not only from upper management but also from day shift to night shift.	company
i would like management to look at expand space avoid warehouse congestion	company
communication between dept still on lack	company
the communication skills that the new station manager has are horrible.	company
communication between stations, especially between eat and west coast is terrible.	company
"we pass along the hallway and can't be acknowledge with a ""hello or good morning""."	company
nobody wants to fall ill and to be confined at home under unpaid leave.	company
maybe hr can be more lenient in granting extended sick leave for such cases.	company
market sharing is share among the cross dept for us to work better and have more understanding.	company
but after a brief discussion in malay / english where all people understand , suddenly they will talk in their own language .	company
comm within all dept need to improve to ensure the job can be done smoothly	company
i was shifted to different team and hr dept.	company
no listen/hear employee idea & need.	company
this problem had several years no improve.	company
more problems are internal fraction in cross team/deptments, they don't know each other and not got good support from each other.	company
more souvenir to be provided	company
too many layers --> time loss, decrease of productivity...	company
please tell us what needs to be improved.	company
especially when working in a smaller office and not the bigger offices.	company
when there are changes & new policies the smaller office doesn't seem to be informed as quickly-	company
suggest to have billing coordinator in local stations.	company
customer service in the stations can be improved and being pro active instead of reactive.	company
we are requesting to have it to different facility as well if possible.	company
also equipment, ethernet, mobiles and some of our programs needs improvement	company
better communication between the day and the night-shift.	company
we ip copenhagen is heavyly depending on intel and information.	company
glad my own direct supervisor doesn't have this issue!	company
sometimes instruction from kam or cs not clarify	company
cross pd is too formal for communicate between different dept, would recommend hold more activities between different dept iso once year outing.	company
they don't tell us what it is all about.	company
the year 2017 has been an extremely trying and stressful year.	company
some people don't reply mail even be reminded many times, and don't pick up the phone.	company
please send mail atleast 1 day before for anything.	company
there the should me monthly survey.	company
don't believe communication outside my department is being passed	company
i personally prefer substance over glitter.	company
#the communication from the team-leaders to the team needs to be improved  #the visibilty of the senior management team inclusive the md is non-existing	company
that makes us fell like chinese fabric workers just doing (no thinking) and no questions asked.	company
using mobile phones in the warehouse while is against dhi policy and some even using them whilst driving heavy fork lift trucks!!	company
comunication betweem office staff and warehouse staff, as well as docs to freight matching ( i.e the correct labels )  docs ( i.e invoices etc ) not being lost between leaving the warehouse to the office	company
warehouse needs to change!	company
the office is also not very good at communicating with each other and the warehouse in making changes with freight.	company
example: you say us on hiring freeze, no merit increase and no travel..yet, 3 people were hired here in atl and one person went to dca for training for 1 day..all after the email..	company
day to day communication has to improve	company
oi's and ccm's are a good start but it doesn't seem to be happening as quickly as i would like	company
the communication between us stations and us	company
improve the recycling ,like plastic bottle	company
yellow box paper.	company
there is too much information going around that doesn't concern you or the station.	company
i fill it is a waste of time.	company
this is not to be directed to the hr team, but rather what is occurring with the other departments	company
every employee  should speak in english.	company
employees should communicate in english instead of their local lanaguage	company
we have decided that we will talk in english on floor.	company
maybe we need a survey to all employees.	company
supervisor taking work home to finish shouldn't be happening.	company
more heads in the workplace, the workloads are at a constant high and most people are working more then 5 hours extra every week, minimum!	company
if it was not for those people the office would not be here in 6 months.	company
man ocean import dept unfortunately.	company
far too much sickness within that dept contributes to the above	company
too much time spent on quote jobs, too much time spent covering for people on the sick	company
not the case at my office.	company
more staff to help on busy routes	company
not working as one team globally (between all departments, asm, ops etc) often linked to lack of resourses.	company
again i don't believe that this will change anything	company
weekly two days off and increase working hours normally 8hrs increase to 2hrs,free transportation, increase overtime money.	company
warehouse assistant job pick and packing &put away only .pls kindly request requirement loading and unloading separate people need.	company

start the day wityear.	company
we cant take loan from dubai islamic still our company is blioked by the bank	company

teamwork is a joke here it's each dept for them selfs	company
we are talked down to not have an opinion on what we say we cant really think outside the box because it is frowned upon .	company
1.we have to put up more team work to smoothen the operation all dept has to worm as one to retain the customer.	company

we missing opinion survey i our department	company
everything is improved, nothnig more don't need to be done	company
just because we don't provide services at the moment i.e.	company
unloading our faks/or loading cntrs for customers, doesn't mean we shouldn't look into it.	company
we need to be more interactive, and need to know or understand importance and working cycle of each and every dept.	company

proactivity should be enhanced by each office.	company
1, expressing oneself openly, honestly and clearly with others;  2, using team member's individual skills and talents to help team succeed;  3, knowing one can rely on fellow team members to fulfill their commitments to the team.	company
more teamwork among functional dept	company
on site visit to facilities (warehouses/cfs etc.)	company
teamwork needs to be improved some people don't know how work in team and sometimes de don't want to help to each other	company
it would be better if the northern border could act more as 1 team, and have the same process from one station to the next.	company
also, please hire more!	company
communication between other departments i.e export ops and warehouse along with team work needs to improve.	company
he can be rude & out of line at times and when that happens i go to sales mgmt for support.	company
this info needs to be accepted by the bid team & work along with boots on the grnd.	company
supervisors are in general very independent, they don't show teamwork, therefore, they don't show an example to subordinates.	company
the us stations i would like to be more responsive.	company
it would be in our clients benefits, when export operations staff would have access to our warehouse again.	company

poor teamwork in orf ops team.	company

so we don't have time to take rest.	company
it needs to improve the work place, like chair it must be fixed and the comfort room, should have one person assigned to maintain the cleanliness even in the night shift.	company
i think needs more to be improved is some of facilities in office like chairs because ost of the chairs is not functioning well and it can cause hazzardous effects in agents.	company
more team building or team outing for example every quarterly or thrice a month.	company

the drivers and dock are finally showing improved attitudes as a whole.	company
i believe the eos survey gives the drivers a voice they never had in the past.	company
the drivers are always getting things done safely and communication throughout the terminal is awesome.	company
it don't get any  better or worse it says the same	company
i think that the purchase of the trucks is working well for the company.although i don't care to drive them because they are not driver friendly.you have to reach for all of the switches and controls	company
my direct supervisor listens and understands but most often can't do anything to help.	company
the trailers are sometimes half full not empty	company

a lot of things that are presented often don't impact a driver on a day to day basis.	company
dispatch is starting to work better nwith the drivers.	company
we are dispatched at times to the same location as another driver.	company
some drivers use the union rules to make it hard on other drivers	company

with being short staffed and busy.	company
i have the tools to do my daily business	company
"it is very useful in daily day along with ""procesledelses systemet""."	company
we have smith training and driver training in chicago.	company
when managment bugs out and lets me earn money for the company.	company
i feel that our employees happiness could improve by being a little more rewording to those who don't feel like they have an important roll.	company
new equipment is saving time by not going to the shop 2 times a week	company
great to have new equipment	company
i feel that at times to pickup and deliver all the freight that the breaks have to be blowen off because you miss important pickups.	company
the equipment has improved, but still needs work with trailer doors	company
less down time for repairs!	company
overall work area bldg.	company
the updated equipment is a huge plus.	company
especially when a hazmat license is required.	company

i think the equipment upgrade is great.	company
the drivers make this company!!	company
getting started early before bid time and the 0 tolerance for  weapons  on the job	company
over past year, i wouldn't say very much else is working well	company
i haven't been working in the company long enough to form a strong opinion on his topic.	company
i was happy to have the company purchase sit stand desks for all of us so that we could be more comfortable being at our desks all day.	company
the sanitation and cleaniness of the warehouse is the only effective thing i have seen working well here in our terminal.	company

equipment is a lot better.	company
very busy which is good.	company
im glad we got new equipment but it needs to be maintained forklifts need work.	company
not enough space for everything that isn't working well with this company!!!	company
how someone can not set brakes ([name]) have his truck roll away and hit another vehicle at a customer and not get fired, makes no sense to me!	company
we usually have the perts we need to repair the trucks & trailers	company
nothing is working well here at the crawfordsville terminal  need drivers	company
the new equipment	company
overall the equipment is better keep it coming.	company
over the past 2 years this company has continuously  deteriorated in every aspect of operation.	company
we continue to miss customer pick ups & even turn down pick up requests when we are short drivers.	company
exception handling via cs is caos	company
some of employees still don't understand or donât want to understand how important are our customers, their attitude to communication in team and with customers is bad and doesn't change...	company
attempts of work-arounds instead of calling cs are time consuming.	company
hq office air quality, ventilation, space, noise level unsatisfactory.	company
this declaration should, then, be stored in the system so that the person picking up the parcel can do so just by presenting his or her id card.	company
[company] network quality is not on level compare to our competitors and customer expectations.there is big gap between cs versus ops .	company
we need to hire when drivers retire so we can service are venders on time.	company
drivers need assigned routes so they can do the same route each day because the customers get to know the individual driver and what to expect from that driver.	company
driver resources are scarce if we hire drivers we wont make money.	company
i don't see a lot of pride in our drivers and they are the face of our company who are in direct contact with our customers.	company
the management doesn't involve heads of department and key employees into the process of decision-making and strategy-setting.	company
strategic decisions aren't being communicated to the employee, and they're incomprehensible, at times.	company
to employees, it looks like important important decisions aren't being implemented.	company
we are battling the same issues with our customers as we did a year ago.	company
a stressful summer has taken a toll on the group.	company
to be honest i feel like this company doesn't care at all about its employees.	company
i even wonder if this survey will be read or taken in consideration.	company
strategy to keep drivers and decide who we are.	company
we see no one from east moline.	company
hard working drivers are rewarded with extra work & more stress, while the lazy drivers are pampered.	company
we can police ourselves & point out the bad seeds, but that doesn't change the mentality of dispatchi	company
milwaukee needs leadership [name] and [name] come and go there never here and they don't listen to anyone its there way or no way	company

md continuously threating with firing people  md does not lead with example (travel and work conditions)  md people policy is not coherent, micromanages, does not motivate, does not support his team, does not treat with respect.	company
at the country level the md should be involved and be more proactive in business and proyects.	company
[company] is not the same company it was few years ago:(	company
"""they are a dime a dozen"""	company
not much more needs said than non-active leadership nothing has changed in 3 years driving moral with drivers in wlo and owa further and further down.	company

our competition dayton,r&l,ups,xpo,estes,fedex what is there average pay scale at?	company
if you want us to care about deliveries we must leave leave  earlier.	company
meaning getting the trucks out on time day and night.	company
blocking & bracing materials such as wood for hazmat&bags are not there.plus the wage scale is a huge problem for recruiting new people.	company
it seems like we are really struggling, late line haul arrivals continue to be an issue as we wait for hours daily.	company
need to get competitive with wages for area, no growth in couple years,less drivers then 3 years ago.	company
no paper recycling or shredding, improve technology for more information without calling, no safety meetings in last 9 months,no confidence in futur	company
we need to make more in chicago.	company
chicago drivers need to make more money to be competitive.	company
company cannot survive without drivers.	company
we need to make more money.	company
sweeping trailers are little things.	company
big things are competitive pay to remain in business and keep good drivers.	company

p and d dispatch	company
this is the only company i have worked for that doesn't tell me how i am performing.	company
i have noticed when day dispatch is on vacation drivers are back anywhere from 1 to 2 hours earlier.	company
imagine the savings in fuel and overtime in a year time.	company
wages and communication on dispatching loads and pick ups to the right drivers	company
better communication with all and a little better heads up on what is happening in the company from day to day.	company
our dispatch needs to be more conscious about our hours behind the wheel and time that dispatch to a pick up is sent to be done, can't request a pick up when it closes in 15 minutes and you are about an hour away.	company
it is unclear in our department why the phones are the #1 job and must be answered at all times; but less then half of us have to be on them constantly and get our side jobs down.	company
driver workload needs to be shared equally or hire more drivers.	company
we still have way too many trailers with missing and damaged placard holders which is required for hauling hazardous materials.	company
and people in office to make phone calls instead of telling us to do it.	company
more training opportunities, and having the opportunity to work your way up within the company, instead of just hoping that a higher-ranking person is having a good day with the possible consequence of you having a better job.	company
we don't have time to learn because we are only the minimum needed people to work.	company
1) more specialized tranings in my field  2) using only one computer program (currently using, soft opac & logis )	company
they don't know a lot of things after training.	company
more trainings but in general ok compared to other bus.	company
more info like pick up # contact names or # or destination	company
trying to retain drivers and recruit new drivers	company
nobody is available to back me up when i'm on a scheduled pto day so i must continue to work several hours per day.	company
provide regular detailed transparency on freight global & country p&ls to middle management	company
better place to park bicycles (rain roof, larger place parking) would demonstrate freight's commitment to environmental responsibility, go-green and well-being of employees (and their bikes).	company
office space needs attention.	company
the mismanagement and tracking of empty trailers is putting a damper on the efficiency of the company.	company
straps for every trailer so we can secure hazmat.	company
the pay rate should be better, i work 12 hours a day go home and sleep for 8.	company
with us drivers working 55 to 60 hours per week i think we deserve average earnings for our vacation pay.	company
low pay has resulted in many drivers leaving.	company
routing, having a consistance route allows the driver to not only build trust with the customer that drop/pics will be timely done, and also allows the driver to know the area so that they can be safe and efficent in doing a seccussful job	company
really don't know	company
quality of european euroconnect services: now there is no responsibility for low quality/delayed operations etc.	company
loads safely getting to their destination and drivers incidents.	company
the management of the trucks.	company
too many it systems involved in the daily business.	company
more often than not, they aren't available and have to be laboriously called up, one by one, on a theoretical basis.	company
it should be the other way around in year 2017.	company
the biggest issue is the late night pickups that slow the dock work down and has employes sitting waiting on loads ,we also  have to much paperwork	company
need to hire more help, i miss stops every day due to lack of time and room.	company
my opinion is we are trying to operate with less drivers to save money which in return we end up with unhappy customers and drivers that are being pushed to hard.	company
breaks ,i don't need to be punished for some one else slacking?	company
time card punch out.	company
you also don't keep doing year after year on night crew  needs to be a rotating so you don't loose people	company
we need a cut off time for pickups.	company
without it drivers are getting back too late.	company
pay .more casual days.listen to drivers	company
trailer check lane still is an inconveniance during winter months!	company
more dock area, and crew	company
the pay to start a good driver is not enough.	company
we wont attract good drivers until we pay more.	company
standard needs scanners on the dock and better systems for us forklift drivers.	company
deck bars will improve the volume we can haul, lack of load straps to secure freight and minimize damage needed.	company
each trailer should have 4 straps assigned to it.	company
your damage claims are high, no heat on dock in extreme winter bad.	company
we need to keep better control of our equipment pool.	company
he need to hire more drivers.	company
we need to improve the driver wages so we can attract and more importantly keep good drivers.	company
issue in the team when someone is on holidays or on sickness leave.	company
if we can't load something then we need to call the client and inform them that the truck will be there the day after.	company
seems to be a lack of cooperation between day shift and nights.	company
it's obvious that those who dispatch days aren't considering what to takes for linehaul to get started in timely manner!	company
dock workers lack sense of proper loading for safe transport!	company
very very hard sell right now and this was not how service was when i started my job here almost 3 yrs ago.	company
working hours are too much -.-	company
i think ,  we should get the christmas bonus	company
this company wastes massive amounts of money on night linehaul.	company
i haven't been working in the company long enough to form a strong opinion on his topic.	company
work too much like to work only 4 nights a week.	company
don't have anything to add.	company
it took a long time before the software on my pc was installed with my new id card.	company
we either do not have enough or we are allowing customers (john deere) to abuse the number of trailers they atre allowed to have at their drop yards.	company
i have seen a terminal manager have a driver forge a customer's signature on a dr when he didn't get the customer to sign it.	company
the dust in this warehouse is too much	company
overtime working is not paid	company
don't know, it seems everything is good.	company
so far, i don't think that anything exactly needs improving.	company
we have to much waiting time in our it systems.	company
for a long time we have been to busy to develop.	company
i feel our company could excel with more drivers and boost moral.	company
additional equipment more supervision more dock space more sales people needed much more freight in areas we could get	company
to be more competitive and bring in new drivers and combat driver shortage a better pay incentives is a must.current incentives are what drivers were making 10 years ago.	company
we are short staffed	company
we need to move away from the influnce of the old culture and those who use there influnce not to the succses of [company]/standardforwading	company
the pay is about 6$ an hour less than other tucking companies pay.	company
so i we probable need to move on if they don't come up next contract	company
it slowly is improving but guys who work the dock should be back earlier to get the dock started.	company
we are not getting out till late and in turn the line haul drivers get out late.	company
higher pay more drivers  staff in general here at the crawfordsville location	company
for the past years the company has commited to update the equipment from computers,tractors,trailes and forklifts but no one seems to notice the spotters request for new ( spotter truks) we are working with realy unreliable spotter truck (chi terminl	company
not enough space provided	company

achieves work targets and is willing to take an additional roles/responsibilities.	team
senior management need to do more team builing with staff to create a happier work environment and bring staff together.	team
achievable and realistic targets	team
need to have backup plan	team
objectives in mind, we should all act as 1 team	team
team work.	team
4) support from overseas	team
company's leadership values not lived by leadership	team
eos actions are very difficult to complete and to engage staff.	team
employing the right people, not family members or friends and holding people accountable	team
i feel the need of clear structure/ sop to be in place so as any new team member feels confident/ more adaptable with their new tasks.	team
salaries have to be increased and staying after working hours to achieve set targets have to be compensated since the set targets are not achievable in the working hours.	team
all departments need to work together to accomplish the eos goal	team
engaging satellite team members more.	team
team leaders does favoritism within the team which is not good at an individual level.	team
we need more facilities to get involved between team among inter-department.	team
my management needs to improve themselves in terms of commitments.they should try to be and act as a leader.	team
the team did not accept my presence	team
have focus on giving hands on training..	team
currently, the team have it separately by their own.	team
to have more activity such as team building	team
i think that senior leadership should be more visible when they are here.	team
having leadership in place that knows their employees and using their best skills.	team
having better leadership in place	team
will be better if the company will be have benefits for parents also because someone have not child.	team
need open discussion with employee to explain company future plan and how employee is important to achieve the goals and how company committed to each employee to grow and flourish within the organization.	team
more engagement would strongly support to meet our targets	team
we are hardly supporting to archive goals in our company.	team
need support from you to achieve that.	team
team work & team bonding, each employ had well knowledge of his/her responsibility to avoid further delay.	team
have a talk with the rest of the team, know their needs.	team
we need to have the right supervisors to lead the team and assist when required proactively  when asked to assist & not at their time.	team
in my opinion the company lacks team spirit on the floor.	team
country level team need to more align with the company objectives & plan to conquer the future world.	team
country team, regional team & global team should live up the same dream, and it can't be only survive in future but to lead the future.	team
the thought which needs to be implanted in the employees mind is '' we work with [company] /not for [company] -- towards accomplishment of common  organizational goal	team
everyone should support positive change and get involved with activities that are offered to them	team
not all the leaders haven't had the time to integrate and teach each one of the members of their team.	team
preferential treatment for team members from team leads is discouraging for other team members.	team
some team members are more motivated than others, team building activities could be improved.	team
i think it will help us to attain organizational and personal goals.	team
leadership team needs to be more emotionally engaged with the front line.	team
team work needs to improve, direct supervisor needs to take interest in development of team members	team
we work well together	team
to many things that each team needs to do for said event.	team
but it will be more effective to add one outing for individual team once in six months to improve the bonding of team	team
concentrate effort on same clear goal - satisfy customer -  create team building	team
team work.	team
leaders should have one set of mind in improving the quality and leadership to their team and be the best example to look on to.	team
set themself an example to team member	team
outdoor activity for 3-4 days should be planned at leadership level	team
a bias set of senior managers with no understanding amongst themselves & no trust on the team members will never give the desired results.	team
communication of strategies and tactical focus to achieve these goals	team
team work,information sharing,trust,dilution of responsibilities,ability to nurture growth and get individuals to deliver instead of taking away opportunities by the team leaders for self promotion.	team
not in the business goals but for our area.	team
my leader is an admin and should be providing support to what our customers are asking us for.	team
my leadership lacks the ability to empower his people.	team
no diversity in leadership.	team
clear communication and guidance from our superiors would be helpful.	team
on respect and results, the respect part is not valued in the americas, leadership from top management is toxic to motivation and healthy work relationships.	team
more support for those on holiday cover.	team
more team leaders are needed ,  as workload /staff is  to many for 1 team leader	team
against each other, instead of together.	team
an employee motivator comes from good active leadership.	team
active supervision and strong relations are key in a company makes by imperfect people trying to be better.	team
the people managers lack skill of emotionally connecting with team members and therefore drive the overall culture within the strategy & certified team.	team
the leaders have got to improve on there judements especially when making decisions that can affect a team memebers performance.	team
leadership needs to be enhanced	team
more realistic expectations regarding financial targets.	team
we need strong leadership in the team.	team
leaders should listen more on teams suggestions to come up an effective strategy.	team
always choose good team leaders with excellent job knowledge.	team
leadership quality has to be improved.	team
active leadership needs to be working in team ip, as i see there is no transparency and no honesty from the team lead and being bias.	team
leadership more than skill , they will support team and  searching solution.	team
honest and trust team we can do good job if we doing together.	team
listening and support it important thing we can do as a leader	team
need the leader to improve  their leadership to their subordinate and being the real leader.	team
the role of leaders  it starts at the top.	team
theyâre the ones that the rest of your company look to for guidance.	team
senior leadership is completely out of touch.	team
active leadership for me, coz it leads the people stay if the leaders are good and effective.	team
hod needs to respect subordinates & need to treat them as one of important team member rather than being giving importance to only intelligent candidates hired form top management schools.	team
review the contribution and ability of the 1-2 of the members of the lt team.	team

there is not really anything i can say for this because many attempts are made to make things work well, but they are never followed through on.	work
a lot of things are starting to work better as a lot of changes have been made in the way the stations are allowed to run their business.	work
hard work is recognized.	work
working well is where you work comfortably and happy.	work
enjoying while on job is one of the factor that you are working well	work

i believe we have a good core structure, despite the multiple systems and applications we have use, we have a good group of staff and a nice, comfortable working environment	work
i enjoy working with some of the team and can see really good potential for the future if we can move on and get passed this difficult period	work
good products difficult to make quick use of them	work
quality of service is not close to being good enough.	work
give the good trining for employe	work
there should be a distinction for [company] working for other companies.	work
things need to be correct the first time.	work
humble approach is must.	work
the canteen is not good enough, as a mnc, we need to respect the request from each of the individuals instead of only one option.	work
it is always best to do thing right the first time.	work
we have come through some really tough times with nfe in the last couple of years, we have lost some really good employees and valuable experience,  i think that all remaining staff should have a freight 101 course offered to them to help with upsell	work
working together as one and putting the customer first	work
we all need to think more out of the box,and help each other rather then passing responsibilities to the next party,be open minded-look,check,do the things right in the first place even it will take longer and will  need more effort.	work
other departments also need to take more responsibility to give the best to customer..	work
attitude is still not there yet - not customer-oriented enough.	work
initiative to get things done right the first time	work
we don't have enough time to get everything done that needs to be done and it not only affects employee morale, but our customers have noticed as well.	work
i think it is fine as it is.	work
rate/ space is major issue and some time we are unable to meet the commitments.	work
really need	work
everyone has a role to play towards quality proposal/pricing/implementation for the good of our cstmr.	work
too many layers to get one thing done.	work
isc has also lost the ability to cooperate-once isc's strongest characteristic	work
this company tore everything apart and now they are putting it back together the same way - should have never made all those changes.	work
customers cant get contacts for answers to questions and are often passed around several times, never really resolving their issues.	work
we get in our own way.	work
if the client asks something we should be able to answer within an acceptable amount of time.	work
unfortunately this time is getting less and less, thus more important that tackle this bottle-neck.	work
can not present to customers, have to take time to analyze and correct.	work
i find that alot of the departments just do what they need to do to get the job done	work
also a better office with more space would be appreciated.	work
lets team up in finding the solution on how we can get back the customers who left, by identifying our mistakes and solving then fight to bring new customers on board for the betterment of our company.	work
to add more hands to improved the job going smoothly	work
nothing to add	work
the most people only want to do their responsibilities, they dont go any further for the internal resolutions.there are fews that are being peachy spots among the others who are enthusiastics and go for the extra mile.	work
everyone should feel that each booking received is important.	work
people need to be motivated .annual increments need to be considered .	work
management needs to sit with people to understand their concern .there is a lot of fire fighting within departments .	work
work in progress already going on to look at good gp customers on board	work
quality comes when each and every one put efforts to achieve it together we need to have this imbibed to each one from bottom to top then one we will achieve quality, it comes with hell lot of hard work and efforts - lets get each one of us do this	work
make sure that the personnel is available until closing time and through out the day regardless of meetings or schedules.	work
employees need to acknowledge the issue and let customer know that they are working on it.	work
we should have the lims,like,intend and must have(the breakeven point)	work
actually it's very good expeirence now and it'll be more efficient if the working environment be more open minded and labor worthly	work
i feel very pleased to work in this environment.	work
we have few concern on the hr person in our location, their professional behavior and we struggle to get things done.	work
timelines too short, so we have to stay up to 2-3 extra hours every day at the office to complete the work on time	work
it would be nice be given some recognition when we have done or are doing a good job, at the moment it feels like only errors are highlighted.	work
staff moral, we are understaffed and we get given so many reports of bits that are late and bombarded with emails because the work load is too much.	work
some people do lots more than others when people are off sick or on holiday.	work
supervisor should tell when the job is well done...we need to feel we are important	work
need to create an atmosphere of employee recognition and climate where the company invests in good people	work
the organizations faith and investment in it's people.	work
faith needs to be restored in the idea that we can put the right people in the right jobs at the right time.	work
personal favoritism has to be stopped to create good working environment.	work
i want to be nice with them but sometimes they are creating first so that case i need to control my self to avoid any issues to us.	work
superior should have good attitude, eliminate pressure to lessen mistake of staff, avoid shouting, and dont scare with warning letter or go to hr straigth,because it will loose compedence of staff to do its daily task, its better to resolve it w/ in	work
like  i believe in my hard work.	work
if company gives us 2 days off in a week that help to rest us .if company gives transportion and accomondation thatis good for us.	work
good overall.	work
i need to all teach every thing	work
we are getinig more pressure  from coustmer for prodectivety so that need to make sure man power equiptment &space then need peaceful maind every mornig .	work
hope we could get festival pension.	work
we talk the talk but don't walk the walk.	work
atmosphere & moral around the office is at an all time low.	work
while i am not speaking from personal experience, people seem unhappy.	work
the environment, the temparature in the office.	work
maybe next time, it will be more relaxing but fun activity for all the employees to enjoy and be a memorable moment.	work
in a number of instances, promotion within the company is restricted to those in the right place at the right time and not open to all.	work
i counted 8  -operators know what to do but not how to do it  -a lot of fear of being entrepreneurial as it isn't in the 'process'/(a lot of red tape)  -mixed messages from smt & higher	work
we hire the best people who know what to do and tell them what to do and what not to do.	work
we need to say what we mean and mean what we say so as to foster trust.	work
we need to listen	work
they gives us false promises.they should change act as a professional.	work
i really don't have any comments, just together as a team.	work
we work a lot of over time and do not claim.	work
sports day schedule.	work
you could say too many chiefs and not enough indians.	work
bring back the things that made us feel important, allow us to do our work, stop with all the babysitting and micro managing, allow us to use the skills that we have.	work
respect, show people that they matter and are not just disposable.treat others, regardless of role, how you want to be treated.it takes a village to be successful.act like it and mean it.words are just that, words, actions are key.	work
i have noticed the main reason why people leave the company is because they find a beter salary, would like to mention this as something that could be improved.	work
maybe the attitude towards work.	work
more work related learning's.	work
management works hard to fulfill that but when time comes hardly anyone contributes.	work
old employees need to be given a chance to prove themselves many of them are like rolling stones, labeled as non performers without given a chance to prove them selves....	work
having leadership in place that know the job and can answer questions.	work
they deserve to get 3i too and same insurance as fte get	work
need more involve in [company] communite members	work
other people needs to be more proactive with their people and other people.	work
these two areas go hand in hand but they barely get together to find out what is viable to sale to the customer and what is not.	work
unfortunately communication will never be enough.	work
i hear a lot of chit chat around me on people being frustrated.	work
amount of work of each individual is not properly organised in my oppinion.	work
so motivation to be the best and to do your best is not growing.	work
as new employees are taken on, these people should be introduced to all staff and then we would know at least what area these people work in and who they are!	work
if someone is away, others who are already busy need to cover	work
coverage for people being away on leave or sick is still very poor.	work
i feel that more could be done in this area.	work
we need to show our people that they are appreciated.	work
make sure there is enough time to handover job/task to new person in charge.	work
work situation is getting more tedious causing lots of pressure to its staff.	work
this is causing an unhealthy environment at times.	work
more learning chances to get to know better about the job.	work
people need to work	work
the over all day to day atmosphere in the office needs improvement and i feel management is to blame.	work
our voices need to be heard more and when we say we are overwhelmed to a supervisor they should listen .	work
to many employees leave here late and frustrated and mad and come back the same way.	work
manages need to know what we do.	work
so they could understand.	work
it seems like they are afraid to take the ball and run with it.	work
promoting this and spreading good tone and behavior among everyone is the key to our success.	work
more staff to do a good job for cnee.	work
let us think about the future	work
a working environment where everybody speaks english  honesty when roles are advertised that the best person gets the job and not one who was promised before hand	work
it would be great if the opprotunity for getting regular position is given to temporary employees more often.	work
demoralizes me to see them not having to work like the rest of us.	work
more supportive managers who get you what you need to assist in doing our jobs effectively.	work
instead of letting people who do nothing work here get rid of them.	work
we need more people who get the job done.	work
we need to get everyone back on track through team building and other exercises so we will continue to be the employer of choice.	work
every thing going good, but required few training class for everyone.	work
would like to see more team building activities.	work
is anybody looking into that?	work
i have no idea what is being asked and everyone i've talked to feels the same way.	work
staff need to move from one position to another ,staff canot  be in one position for 13years it does not motivate workers.	work
the condition of service need to be reviewed.	work
this is one of the toughest situations in nigeria that is capable of affecting staff morale negatively.	work
resources to get the job done  4.	work
also need atleast one way ticket per year to family	work
they should give credit to those who are really working hard & contributing and not to those whom they like.	work
we could be better at informing each other about upcomming events.	work
lot of middle level employees are ignored to take there suggestion to improve quality of work required in different areas, no positive suggestions are acceptable and work is going on as usual since lot of years ago.no change as per business requiremn	work
communication/information to do a good job efficiently	work
my mangers trust my judgement to get the job done	work
less opportunity for promption although we work harder,get enough achievement and take more responsibility.	work
the atmosphere in here is of out for one's self.	work
too much micro managing causing people to feel they can not make decisions as they will be questioned, criticized and made to feel not empowered.	work
i have seen very happy people turn miserable	work
[company] needs to stop treating us like liabilties and start treating us like people with responsibilities and families out side of the four walls we work in.how can you be under a mandatory evacuation and told you can leave but only if use your pto.	work
actually, we are in the works of getting more business in our door which has been needed for quite some time.	work
we never seem to let anything take hold before shifting direction again.	work
accountability at the station level i think to many times we miss the mark because [company] implements plans and trainings and they are not followed up on, so things go back to the same as they were prior.	work
it's tough to stay motivated when compensation does not equal the hard work invested in the company.	work
when we ask for help on site at the customer or resources it would be greatly appreciated that someone will be able to help us directly.	work
employee need to be taken care by having several meeting only with them this would built trust as well as their loyalty towards the organisation	work
i think positive feedback or recognition when a job is well done would be great for productivity.	work
for me is the work relation to each other.	work
maybe done already?	work
it would be good to see everybody take part in discussions and suggestions for improvement.	work
- differentiation: good employees - who accomplished their goals - should be rewarded accordingly.	work
the majority of people come to work to do a good job.	work
nothing to report at this time.	work
employees should still enhance their dedication to their work.	work
and more fun days so that teams can engage.	work
because of this all the people who actually work with skill and seriousness will be rewarded.	work
more employee engagement activities in order to have more commitment to each other as well as to gain knowledge and great experience in a company with a good working environment like [company].	work
there is lot of work done in sylo.	work
it's all just work is going on and that's it.	work
identify right talent to delivery right job in an effective and efficient way.	work
i will thus not provide a reply to this question.	work
we feel undervalued and unappreciated.	work
that people feel valued, both personally as in their work.	work
restructure process started but then stopped suddenly with no explanation.	work
i have suggested lots but so far none have properly been look into.	work
still too much company politics	work
you always wonder if you will be the next to be fired.	work
walk the talk	work
"less ""artificial"" events like the appreciation week - to appreciate the work of others should be a natural attitude for every day and not writing messages during a defined week"	work
us mgt not leading w/ respect; no clear strategy how to turn around the us;  too many people on all levels do not take on ownership/accountability, are not value-adding, reasons seem to be bandwidth, direction, skills, et	work
smt must walk the certified talk by role-modeling the values everyday and making sure that employee engagement starts with them.	work
i have witnessed on multiple occassions where knowledge was attempted to be shared and the senior manager immidiately interupted, refusing to listen.	work
this job could be done by 10 well paid, well supported, and effective people, but instead we struggle to manage with twice as many as that.	work
some time senior gives unnessary pressure to junior to make the work done.and unnesessary extra taking which is not good.treat the employ with respect.	work
team leads need time to engage with employee, this is difficult for them when they do not have time to dedicate to staff.	work
we need to simplify the process to take action faster when there is anything needs to be done.	work
leader are well known and have good knowledge about product and all things whatever going on.	work
- promotions are not always given bases on good and hard work	work
management must:improve their attitude and recognize ones for the hard work and contribution, 2.must improve management skills instead of mistreating someone, they have to talk in good way to motivate staffs, 3.take employee 's opinion into account.	work
the acknowledgement and reward for a job well done	work
my manager does not recognize or no appreciation whatever job done on daily basis under on my desk level, they can see only our error and they feedback negatively as always.	work
our management here does not seem to want to listen to the employees and use our ideas as to what we think would work best to make this place a better work environment.	work
there is so much that can be discussed in this subject...the most important is that the management needs to make the employees feel that they are appreciated for the work they do and the 100% effort that is given on a daily....manager teamwork!!	work
boss you should walk the talk!	work
instead, help us find solutions, we always waste time listening to unnecessary things you are saying.	work
good worker does not make good leader.	work
management should be able to anticipate problems that may happen before they actually happen.	work
job security of the employees	work
2.we require rest room, we have that is not enough for 20 to 25 staffs.	work
manager,who has the authority to ask their employees when there is any sort of failures orr delays, then the same manager forget to appreciate his/her employees when they put extra efforts to get the job done.	work
stop looking at their feet when they walk and make eye contact!!!	work
sups and tl.sups talk to you like you a kid and are very petty,dont work the boxes,look and talk about everybody in the dept.tl dont like answering questions for you to do you job correctly and in a timely matter.limit space cant write all comments	work
i don't really get feed back unless something goes wrong.	work
there is really no communications i have to constantly ask question which is fine but when i ask to make sure i get multiple answers from the same people or multiple people.	work
to supervisors placed in positions due to who they know, and not what they know.	work
we intent to deliver our best for get the job done, however we need the company support as usual.	work
supervisor needs to better job at communicating with team members.	work
a good morning would be the first step to better communicating	work
mgmt should take the time to get to know all the empls, not just the ones that need special attention.	work
training plus ensuring the right people are in the right positions.	work
get managers that know what they are doing and hire people because they are their friends and they don't know nothing about the industry	work
if i tell my supervisor i am putting extra time in my job she will respond and say this is for your own benefit.	work
she will never see the good that i am doing only when something go wrong i will here her voic	work
employees waste so much of the companies money by doing whatever they want when no one is looking.	work
you kept the same manager that ran cae into the ground and fired all of the ones that tried.	work
a leadership standard is still yet to be established where there are at times line managers are still managing by the do as i say or fear tactics and not through leading by example, empowering us or inspiring us.	work
right people in the right place	work
we are wasting time to not so important things rather then dealing with the once that are very important.	work
also, take some of the suggestions in and at least try to implement them.	work
it was great and positive to do training such as cif but when you get back the workplace it seems as though all is forgotten.	work
great leaders always great simplifier.	work
to divide the job equally.	work
just giving his or her job to us.	work
ceos shall take leading roles to employ different peoples from different parts of world according to their talent not color skin and nationality.	work
our time is not working.	work
some come in at 8:30 with 10:00am cuts and that put us in a stage where we are rushing	work
management needs to show up to work and or resign.	work
team leaders are not doing their job properly.	work
when everyone has a question we can go to anyone.	work
i strongly agree many people have multiple things they could see improvement on.	work
i would like to see the company bring back more leadership trainings.	work
working atmosphere to be improve, no respect to the staff.	work
they need to start seeing us as people and not just files/money!	work
get our mgr well dressed for his position and teach him how to run a big organization without loosing  the grab of who he is.	work
right now we are spending too much time telling each other what the other colleague did wrong.	work
some managers need to focus on leading by example, which i believe will go along way.	work
small accounts are given less importance than the big ones.	work
we have been having continuous changes - which is fine but what really is worrying is that for example we were compelled to hire telesales after so much of pushing from  regional office and then after we finally recruited now they want us to fire !!	work
ask responsibility from staffs, but no clear and right directions.	work
top leader must direct the business in the right way.	work
everything but i would like some empowerment on my duties and specify them  i would like everyone to know who i am and that they really count on me no just assuming i have the power to do things or that i do it because i like to mess with people	work
when i first started in this company everything was great  i always got the proper training supervisors were willing  to help agents now supervisor don't want to take ownership.	work
work performance, and supervisors who actually know and care about their jobs.	work
it is always said things should be brought to management's attention to be corrected, when truly it is a waste of time.	work
noone wants to appreciate you for just doing your job good daily.	work
constanly dis connected to what is going on.	work
sometimes just listen to what the reason is that we cannot get all parts of the process done.	work
not to mention, colleagues that actually want to do their jobs.	work
would like to see more leading by example from product managers.	work
sadly senior management and sales think they know everything but they don't and they wont even ask their ops people who do know	work
they are over worked and have no back up, when they are out everything falls apart.	work
environment is threatening & dictatorship.	work
senior leadership sometimes i believe that they just say what they think you want to hear rather than finding solutions.	work
not getting always support & need to send reminder to get answer.	work
not distribute the work fairly between the team.	work
the way the managers are acting is the main issue  they don't motivate anyone  there are moments that we can say they don't know or understand what are doing  they must understand that are managers not bosses  they must act like humans with feelings	work
should always check if someone has management skills  and the post should  be advertised to give people  a chance to apply.	work
they keep asking only questions to country !	work
a good leadership who really needs to takes care of the employee	work
managers need to sit back and look his/her staff sometime i see some empoyee with red face imean crying with tears and to myself its not right if i was manager i will help them even if they done a mistake or anything that his/hers might upset them	work
need to save the money?maybe do something with the person that does nothing and cost us 500k per year.	work
person that spends 25% of work time on toilet.disappears when work arrives.person that lowers our morals and makes our work harder and frustrating.	work
the smt need to look at what is needed on the ground such as new xray and not wasting money moving offices .	work
because of this i don't feel my feed back or voice is heard.	work
management seems ignorant.	work
they need to learn appropriate vocabulary and not offensive talk.	work
our direct supervisor should listen his team's real feeling and should know what they really need to improve and how they do their daily jobs .	work
the team leaders attitude really affects everyone it the team.	work
you need to exchange your though with your employee and you need to know how to accept others opinion.	work
hope management can look into this issue and distribute workload fairly, reasonably.	work
employees need to know that they are valued, that their work is important and that they matter.	work
this way employee will motivates to work hard, grow & develop to take leadership.	work
[company] need to understand what we actually do onsite, maybe they could come and work alongside the guys whilst the work is actually being done?	work
communication from management above my level:management saying and doing the same thing:management saying one thing to one person then contradicting it by saying something completely different to another:i need more room to say everything i want to	work
it woudl be nice to have more time put aside	work
management needs to stop demanding change and start helping change things and take action to help the team when we need and ask for it.	work
other departments need to stop refusing to help as it is an inconvenience when we ask for help.	work
2.high potential employees should be made to feel valued and appreciated for taking additional responsibility.	work
i think the managers need to be more open to their subordinates.like for example immersion in work to know how the process and the stand of the employees.to see how they see things.	work
i think what it needs to be improved is how the senior leader treat the employee well on how they recognize the people hard work in the team.	work
"""field of dreams"" movie...""if you build it, they will come""."	work
we need to do a better job in really prioritizing topics and ensuring that we are resourced to manage them.	work
we will continue to fail unless that track is changed.	work
we always go back to the 'old' way.	work
we got a new ceo, but we didn't really hear what he actually wants, what his ideas are, but it is time for us to understand how it is supposed to continue because at the moment we are in a valley + and the last years have been frustrating, we need hope!	work
i do not see how and where to gain back our market strength which i do not see being in a great form.	work
floor people working very hard.	work
floor people are working very hard.	work
we are getting transport allavance only 250.but we are paying 300.	work
good to great	work
get the correct people on the correct customer	work
& people are working as an island and are result driven, losing any creativity, vision, pro-activity.	work
way too much politics.	work
however i feel at the end of the day people here are to earn.	work
nothing to be done, if i change my department i will be able to perform.	work
should work on expanding the biz.	work
i feel with the amount of stretch/shrink wrapping that is done on a daily basis, some equipment for this job duty/function is needed to fulfill the job more efficiently.	work
decisions are slow  too much red tape for small things  some reports could be avoided	work
4: company must give laptops to whit color jobs person .	work
my supervisor should have to follow policy regarding sick/late days, should have to make up time regardless of being salary.	work
[company] is overall a great place to work at so it is hard to find something to find where they need improvements but if i had to say one thing if they would encourage future educations classes that will help our future development.	work
just to stay the same and work to be done as well	work
listen to the base	work
it takes more time than needed to adapt to a situation when there is a big change.	work
kpi targets are exciting; a figure you personally make a huge impact on everyday and feel good for achieving	work
looking at smt pds is quite depressing.	work
we need to lead with better quotes first time.	work
if people didnât care about their job or the company they wouldnât say anything	work
email, the content must be simple and straight forward so frontline staff can understand easily.	work
can produce much simplier message.	work
do not have the idea when cut-off or layoff will get stopped.	work
right now everybody is only worried about their working area because all he pieces have been tore apart.	work
similar drive for other department that will collaborate and support this drive.	work
listen to your employees who handle the work, we know what is working and what is not, yet [company] continues to do the opposite of what's best.	work
no opportunity to grow, no flexibility,environment is very strict,no appreciation etc	work
i think having more meetings or something explaining what the plans are and how we are going to get there would be best.	work
we just feel like numbers.	work
need to feel appreciated yet we take away merits and our employee recognition.	work
we hear that the us is making improvements but we still have little clue who is doing what in some of the stations and rarely get timely responses to emails.	work
feeling of job stability.	work
are there enough channels and links to filter the best of talent to reach the top so that they can contribute in the best way.	work
and i think this is a pity.	work
give clear priorities, not everything could be done at the same time.	work
investment in people, we are getting old new blood is needed.	work
process, service, give importance to employees who are doing the job, love his /her work, dedicated to his/her work.	work
hope it can be ceased and moved on the right track once its being confirmed.	work
team work more strongly, tool more completely, working atmosphere	work
back to the basic must be not forget, make it simple should more than an slogan but a reality, leadership of the company should work with the low level of coworker	work
need to improve and fix the edm scanning.half the time is down or something wrong with it that we have to scan over and over again our work, by doing that it take much of your time doing that so we can meet are kpi.	work
very sad to see....	work
i hope i'm wrong	work
we need more employees to get the job done.	work
still confused about the operating system we will be working on.	work
and the fact that the smt is not always an example of integrity and non-discrimination.	work
i think they forgot they are people too.	work
we are missing the mark to get us back on track.	work
everything going great.	work
surprising the new country manager speech.without knowing us he has bad opinion on few employee-some were already in good books.	work
not good atmosphere to work with.	work
only need cooperate more than we already are to give the best possible performance .	work
we do need more full time people not agency	work
too much turnover, keeping things running with few resources is very complicated.	work
changes never seem to have a clear direction, it's always about experimenting with this or that to see how it goes and if not, let's fire people.	work
nothing is working well, worst management in sg afr up to date. dont know the process my god!	work
for me everything is good, i think the company takes care of the employees as and when required.	work
we cant do everything and do it well.	work
we cant be everything to everyone, and performs everyone's tasks.	work
conflicting message.	work
i think we need to balance our talent better.	work
it is really tiring now and really bad communication from management, basic level employees cannot understand why we change directions so many times and where we are going at mo.	work
too many leaving because they can not see where they are heading	work
everyone will get it.	work
i feel like we could communicate better to get things done quicker and more effectively	work
even when working together we still work in a disjointed way, or at least that's how it looks and feels in terms of how communications are managed.	work
everything in our company are well equipped.	work
jobs being advertised within your team and being unaware that we were recruiting.	work
team work is not there, atmosphere in the office can be a horrible work environment.	work
to use peoples skills in the choice of their job - the right man/woman on the right job.	work
team meetings are individually held by team, we think sometimes a big meeting is best then everyone hears the same think as when done separate then some messages get mixed up	work
although we practice the teamwork,sometimes we miss understand each other.	work
we cannot communicate well sometimes what my team mates says miss understood my other mates.	work
training of staff to perform every day at the best and actually tell customers what is happening if issues arise	work
for the moment people are appointed and we are not aware of all opportunities.	work
effective communication can help to handle  the difficult situation in an easy way .	work
we need more senior supervisors to involve us	work
i would like to suggest, if every department can support each other to make thing happen.	work
we want to hear from you and we need to be heard.	work
listen to hear and not to response.	work
being the smallest denominator in the chain - i feel like taken for granded.	work
fortunatelly for me, i take my own initiative to do my work independably and to the best of my ability	work
many a times communications only happen when changes have already taken place or even after that, which is not correct as per me.	work
most importantly, feel free to open it to the employee so that they are aware.	work
permit side the guy need to check the docs and pass to person back.	work
communication skills among stuff especially when ones go on leave	work
some issues between departments was not handled professionally.	work
they know nothing about it.	work
the only improvement i could see would be to maybe leave the notes from previous day up until the next meeting and have a short review for anyone who wasn't here a may have missed out on something important	work
seems everyone has there own way and no one want to share information that would make the job easier.	work
making it difficult for anyone to take accountability.	work
it can be difficult to focus on the task that you perform at certain point in your day.	work
consider imposing some discipline to give yourself a full time to those tasks require your concent	work
not taking ownership when things go pear shaped.	work
everyone should know other people task in the team so that we can help each other.	work
new people are stating all the time and i have no idea who they are or where they work in the company	work
thus it makes it difficult to find any reasonable time to communicate or ask for any help/advice.	work
"it appears as though we generally find out things from ""the great vine"" rather than from the source itself."	work
not offshoring work and having to do the same work twice.	work
it improved compared to last year , but still needs  work to be done.	work
for us to do our work on time and correctly we need some people in certain areas to insert the job notes	work
having an open-communication when it comes to work.	work
communication via e-mail need to be more attractive as sometime it is too busy to read all incoming e-mails, and some of them may be over looked.	work
you needs to remind them all time, that things got done together.	work
as an employee i would love to see my opinion as an employee being valued, i feel like when ever i come to our staff to speak up for our team no one ever do that.	work
we need better communication, we always find things out after they have happened.	work
it's important that we know what's going on as well or what will go on so we are aware.	work
i will spend most of my day e-mail and calling truckers to make sure they are doing their job.	work
weekly meetings have been cancelled, and i feel that our voices are no longer being heard.	work
get more knowledgeable supervisors/managers ,maybe less meetings ,every time we look for a supervisor they are either on the phone or in a meeting ,they are not on the floor to answer questions	work
we did not see anction item from the out come of last eos.	work
its okay to give bad news too	work
people should not be able to turn skype off, it is better to switch the status to busy than to appear off-line which is misleading.	work
let us know what is going  on.	work
it is very difficult to find out who to contact for internal issues.	work
letting the employees know that they are doing a good job.	work
there is a disconnect between us...the employees do not feel we can speak freely/candidly about issues without feeling singled out for speaking out.	work
most times people who apply, do not hear anything back from the application nor get a chance to interview.	work
if china is not sure, they should still take an action.not send a question overnight and lose a day.	work
organization: exemple ishare: very difficult to navigate into the system.	work
things said can easily change so we are all insecure about our jobs	work
airport office everything going properly and as per me no need anything to improve	work
2) more informations from direct supervisor to be able to get the job done.	work
that is not good and creates a bad enviroment.	work
the way someone talks to one and other.	work
they use very bad words and that its not nice at all.	work
there is no room for growth , jobs change without any notice you just realize oh i'm not doing that anymore but no one tells you.	work
i would like to see an informal group meeting at the start of shift outlining any changes that may have taken place.	work
safety needs looking at with regards to space in the hayes warehouse, there is nowhere near enough room to operate safely and effectively at times, and the 2 metre rule is impossible.	work
meaningful data is not always easy to come by.	work
the agents can tell when something is going to happen and leadership has a way of wanting everything kept a secret.	work
you can ask a supervisor and or a lead and you will receive two way different answers.....i feel at this time that we are should get together and ask why the there is such a difference in their answers.	work
nothing that i can think of at this time.	work
we would like to feel encouraged and supported by our good job.	work
sometimes my team needs to take a step back to allow the station to work with their customers.	work
the computers sometime does not work well im having hard time in saving some file that are shared	work
people interpret there meanings and can get confused or mis-lead.	work
is not an easy thing to but it is important to totally understand this business.	work
can use an 'anonymous suggestion box', as people are not always comfortable to bringing up their concerns, so it would help employees to anonymously comment on things they would want to see improved, this is a another way to improve workplace.	work
sometimes we do not know what is going on	work
as i think it is important that the management knows what is going on in their team,  it seems like management stop caring bout what the staff think as one to one meetings, which has stopped and not being conducted for a quite long time.	work
also telling us important details that we need to know when it comes to the company or in team.	work
each person in department is overwhelmed with so much work.	work
we need employees who want to come to work rather than using it as an excuse for long term sick.	work
we have really to improve this point quick	work
desire to change - too many people, teams take the view that if they ignore something they do not need to change and can just carry on they way they have always done something despite impact on other people, teams.	work
it would be nice if i could rely more on my superior.	work
nothing specific everyone will work hard for companyâs future betterment.	work
nothing specific everyone should work hard.	work
and happy to say that we have a ggod leadership and good plat farm to grown up	work
i feel things could be improved if we had two days off a week instead one day off.by doing and getting more rest will increase productivity and motivation at work.	work
everything is good in my eyes	work
get back to the basics.	work
we need to make a difference treatment/target for each branch and must understand and hear what their challenge and help them to solve the issue if the challenge is out of their capacity.	work
if there will be team work than things will have a better flow	work
if [company] want to succeed in the way they want to.	work
they need to look at how things are being done and have some respect for the people and support them to get a top quality job done.	work
the office team - need to understand the pressure the warehouse is under, the office staff are alway moaning about their jobs, if they dont like it then they sould do something about it, we are all a team but they dont want to work with the warehouse	work
time will speak.as now every thing working well	work
nothing comes to mind	work
teamwork is not actively promoted as everyone seems to do their own thing to a certain degree	work
still so difficult to get things done.	work
effectively training people, ridding the comp of dead weight a person who is not looking to learn help grow pulling their weight along with the rest of their team.	work
the team work could be more effective if worked together and help each other with more effectiveness and willing to cooperate.	work
some senior members interfere in the work which they have a very little experience and they try to  change the working guidelines which have been going smoothly for years  and trying to put the customers in problem since the freight is not moved .	work
at this moment there is wrong in our warehouse	work
our current direct line manager does not allow our inputs and he wants all to be done his way and he constantly reminding us that he is in charge and we are nothing and he decides what goes or not even if its in a favor of a client.	work
i think we need to make better instructions for situations when somebody is on vacation or on sick leave.	work
i personally do not like to 'settle' for less than my best because there is not enough bandwidth.	work
nothing as i see it now.	work
perhaps can get improve schedule of back up list	work
nothing, we are in right track	work
need to improve the return of endorsed d/ns from the transport/contractors to close as much files as possible.	work
3.supervisor doing only his self appreciation not for the staff who do good job  4.partiality and preferenc	work
only thing i want to share her managers and supervisor are showing their interest while doing the pd because of that activities we are losing our interest to improve.	work
"the ""work, work, work"" mentality that comes from the top down and the hire someone just to fill a seat isn't working."	work
it would be nice on reviews to not have it noted you need to work with team better when it just pertains to 1 person, even if it does offend that 1 person	work
it like the picture on the message boards.	work
we always work on something diferent, to work as a team  a lot of communication	work
out with  the lazy and in with the  ready to  work and achieve would be nice.	work
not happy about certain waste of time system ie oi it is causing a lot of conflict amongst the staff, people take it personally and get upset.	work
i feel as though the disciplines have not been drilled down enough.	work
the people must love each other	work
once a year is not enough.	work
the staff needs to be awarded for all the hard work and their commitments to completed the job on time.	work
team work is key to making things happen - if everyone works together then what we offer our customers is 10 times better - still work to be done	work
to teach employee the attitude of finger pointing whose fault but as a teamwork	work
there are people that work here who think it is a place for their social life instead of putting their energy into work first .	work
i think there should be a lot more support for the managers in dealing with these type of people	work
promote cross-dept working.	work
certain staff need to be more open0minded and not  target/make life difficult for others... everyone is here to fulfil/carry out a job role...	work
explaining things to customer is way easier than explaining things to other departments.	work
and refresh our mind.	work
job sharing between team  i see that suvervisor  get less job than another in a team	work
every departments have their own kpi's /  iko's, this create a culture where all just want to protect their own interest rather than work together to get things done /  solutions	work
since we work for longer period and chances for us make mistake are higher.	work
try to good.	work
need close communiation and team work, encourage everyone to take responsibility for same goal, even same single shpt.	work
if you are not part of the main office, there are some issues that needs of a team work and sometimes we don't receive it from our colleagues.	work
in fact, they are always trying to find a guilty not a solution	work
sometimes word spreads fast behind that person's back.	work
i think this needs to be worked on a little more.	work
we need to get rid of the union.	work
we need more bodies, we can not continue to lose employees and expect our current employees to absorb the work of others with out getting replacements to take on the work.	work
something which i think is essential, it's to be able to communicate well with bosses and with the work group and that there is never a preference for someone in particular, this causes the work group to appear divided.	work
i always get help from my colleagues..i just have to open my mouth and ask for help and i get it.	work
it would be useful at least one team meeting per month to communicate and see what works good or worst and how can we improve our work.	work
from my point of view, everything is working very well.	work
i think sometimes between states it feels like you work for a different company when you need things done or help.	work
need to listen from others	work
we are doing great as a team, we need to continue doing better to get the best out of it.	work
it systems and attitude of a few employees towards work.	work
in the sales department, we dont know what other colleagues are struggling or accomplishing each other.	work
i have seen lot of finger pointing within the orga.	work
nothing right now	work
send information together to keep daily flow work run smoothly	work
the understanding that we all have our own minds and different opinions but we can agree to disagree should be worked on.	work
we have great team work but with busy schedule we ended up not being able to do a whole lot of those activities.	work
the warehouse agents would greatly appreciate that very much.	work
things should not get biased in terms of process and leaves.	work
it would be nice to have a once a year get together with my team since we are across the country apart.	work
need appreciation from my immediate supervisor for the hard work and overtime put in to achieve the tat and team target	work
we are work together & enjoy our work than get success	work
i enjoying my work	work
members who actually work hard gets ignored.	work
not my job, inflexibility, making things more difficult/time consuming than they need to be.	work
sincerity, do things straight from your heart.	work
which makes it almost impossible to have any kind of team work.	work
sometimes instead of collaborating, flaws are highlighted to make their work stand out and shadow the work of others.	work
we are going well at the moment.	work
nothing particallary at the moment	work
i think if we all can just spend more time as a team we can accomplish more that what we're doing at the present moment.	work
our team very hard work and truly.	work
together everyone achives more	work
although the team i am part of works very hard i feel like there are teams and other shifts that tend to let the side down and cause other shifts to suffer	work
sometimes feel there needs to be more meetings with management to find out how things are going and to hear our feelings	work
cigarette breaks should be allocated to a curtain time and not when they just feel like it.	work
our new station manager is doing what he can to improve things but it is really up to the individuals to work together.	work
there is so much knowledge and experience here, but everyone is afraid of working together as a team, because they feel like its not their job or duty to go the extra mile.	work
everyone takes care of their individual area and sometimes it's not what is the most necessary for the team.	work
team work - supporting others to achieve outcomes rather than just blaming others when expectations are not met.	work
people should understand that they are working for the company & help each other rather than turning a blind eye on the mess the other person is going through.	work
each team needs to work well and enjoy to do their jobs.	work
nothing to improve, you all are doing a great job.	work
worked on team where one or two voices tend to dominate the group, and other people's ideas are not heard.	work
people being acknoledged for there hard work	work
there are still too many individuals in the team	work
work as a team in practice but then in reality everyone just sticks to their own stuff.	work
it will likely mess things up.	work
i believe there needs to be better training in both cust. service and operations.	work
instead they find way to get by instead of learning .	work
training for staff, more staff for the volume of work, less stressful environment to work in	work
it would be good to invest in time - time to carry out other tasks, sit with colleagues in an effort to cross train.	work
i'm still seeing people getting on boarding without the proper training.	work
we loose too many good people early  and believe that everyone is replaceable.	work
recently we had town hole meeting  for all the employs my observation it was good but if its within the company limit i would like to ask if this kind of meeting can be done in hotel maybe in weekend	work
the right person in the right place.	work
i want to learn more about my work	work
first of all you have to tell them clearly about what is the job what your going to do and what skills you need.	work
i'm with the company a long time.	work
the company general environment & structure	work
we just need to make sure all of the fte's are having a great learning from the start and to make them sure that they are aware about what they are going to do.	work
constantly repeating the same mistakes instead of getting it right first time which is affecting how we are able to do our job	work
we do not have enough back up and there are not enough of us to do all the work required.	work
the company only measures on numbers, but forget what is required before you get to those numbers.	work
i have to learn some of the procedures to complete the task given on time	work
this means that i am not fully doing the job that i was employed to do.	work
i think most people train better from humans training and not reading everything.	work
i was not properly trained to do my best.	work
although most of our staffs are doing well but there are still some need to be coach	work
training: there needs to be enough people to train adequately and enough time for more productivity.	work
there is not enough space for me to say what needs to be improved since we arent allowed many characters to express what we feel.	work
majority of people wait for one person to do the training and then everyone else copies the answers to get a passing grade.	work
time is running fast and we have to learn evberyfday	work
if i can do mytalentwork course at home, i will be much easy to develop myself.	work
we rarely see that happen.	work
your mind is your problem.	work
what needs to improve is not moving agents out of an area because you feel the need to try something new - this puts stress on the agent left behind to do the workload all by them self and causes people to get behind on work.	work
there needs to be better training for all positions within the job.	work
if all of e-training which have mutliple language selection, which will be much better.	work
maybe more people working in the office less stress	work
as a new hire, there is a lot of information to absorb - i think a nice thing would be to train each employee more specifically within their job title/responsibility as opposed to a broad spectrum of information.	work
we need better training options	work
better preparation/organization prior to the start date would be beneficial to everyone.	work
we should be learn about leap like  listen  empathize  acknowledge  problem-solve	work
hr needs to be more proactive to address what we as staff needs to equip ourselves better our jobs and beyond.	work
from my side, its all good already	work
we are working but not properly compenstated	work
need to give priority for seniors and capable staffs who are able to work same job.	work
i wish we could do pasanger escorts, it will help us learn how does the weels turns at the other side.	work
i like all the training given to me to better perform my job	work
we need more supervistors to be a bit respectable around here and [company] need to treat all of there workers the same with ot	work
hr do not seem to have any concern about talent development, it do not seem to have much concern about employees not having sufficient equipment to get their jobs done.	work
on the job training needs to be documented and those local work instructions and procedures aligned with corporate bp/guidelines.	work
managers are rude and insulting.	work
this is difficult to the lack of available time.	work
every day is a struggle trying to get the simplest task complete	work
support for the employees, it seems to be a case of just get the job done and no one listens when we say we need help or support	work
structured payscale to work towards on progressinf in company	work
makes us feel under valued and incompetent.	work
older long time served colleagues seem to get more recognition for their work when we are all one team.	work
senior managers should also take the time to get to know individuals.	work
when people are on holiday or training or off sick we need more people when working in a small team.	work
very solo team feel.	work
an air condition would be good	work
the indoor climate.	work
it would be helpful to have just one workspace so you could keep all your material together.	work
the office that i currently work in is sometimes not conducive to a healthy and safe work environment.	work
recently there have been times where we've had to do unsanitary things in order to allow the office time to fix plumbing issues.	work
i hope that they would provide us more scanners for the efficiency.	work
need support from direct incharge in the workplace	work
man power resources so we can all do our jobs effectively	work
work can run over set work times.	work
job fullfilment is a must	work
staff feel unmotivated to	work
so very noisy and busy environment.	work
which i deserve after working for years to get this position.	work
takes time away from running the business	work
the people in the offices need to be better with the warehouse they are alwyas moaning about warehouse but they sit at desks just mooaning they should get up and come and see us in the warehouse we work very hard and they just moan about us, we are g	work
wmployee welfare and working condition	work
there's a reason why [company] is losing good talent.some of us wear lots of hats for the purpose of 'saving' money.i don't believe i will be here for the next eos unless something changes.	work
its unfortunate that i'm writing this.	work
need to really really make employee feel special and not just superficially.	work
it would be really great if this matter is taken care of asap to help tennured employees stay motivated and upbeat.	work
as we are all working hard , doing our efforts and so on to prove ourselves.	work
this would enable lot more employees to start think out of the box, which would in turn benefit the company in lot of ways.	work
i always see lack of human resorces around which makes thing worse (people keep leaving [company]jp).	work
wha is working outside danzas facility.	work
this year no raises and no hiring, and final cut is taking the only that most people look forward to when coming coffee.	work
people working at the isle.	work
i think that this leads to unsatisfied individuals and bad mood that potentially force people to search for other jobs and to leave our company(to our competition)	work
better working conditions and technical appliances.	work
money talks are dismissed and taboo.	work
this has just been a horrible experience as a new hire	work
i feel the supervisors are not prepping their leads for the next step.	work
some of the stuffs are not comfortable like chairs..	work
can make it be a better place to work in	work
need only to get the work done not bothered about staff.pd discussions are dragging for more than 1hr waste time no respect for staff during pd.yelling & shouting by supv.	work
there is not even one word.	work
some relaxing games or something company have to implement.	work
often the stars are leaned on to take on more regardless if they have the capacity.	work
happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after achievement off a difficult task that demanded the best and been appreciated by our supervisor	work
i still do my job and i do it well.	work
yet i'm constantly given more responsibility above my job tier.	work
continuing ed. has stopped in-house and needs to be brought back.	work
and when asked, we are given excuses instead of help.	work
the free form area of the eos should allow more characters, the space is often too small for well thought out and well written responses.	work
although the legal requirements for the work environment are respected, we work stowed like a chicken battery with a way too crowded open space with too much noise and people breathing all together in one room	work
food is still terrible.	work
more job related training will be really good	work
do not look into how much we do safe cost and later our money flow is going negative way...please promote those are capable to handle all kind of task...producvity ...leadership..understanding...job knowledge...	work
need more people.	work
- working environment ( too old style, gen-y mostly will not stay long for this kind of working environment.	work
better work environment.	work
sometimes you feel a little used.	work
you do the job above your job description and no one wants to give you the position  or pay you deserve.	work
it is clear that not doing your work or not coming to work is necessary.	work
not feel limited to what you can or cannot do.	work
the company wants us to learn and do more, but they give nothing in return.	work
my direct supervisor can (at times) be very unprofessional and it makes for very toxic environment.	work
no time to be trained properly and well on anything as there are a million other things to know and do.	work
toxic environment.	work
unfortunately they will truly value what they have when it's gone.	work
sometimes switching a task from one department/station makes sense.	work
feeling overwhelmed more work is pushed to certain functions without additional manpower, setting us up to fail.	work
we barely have the time to complete the work in the time we have.	work
hiring process is a miserable joke.	work
most times, we are overwhelmed and are asked to help out other departments.	work
need to upgrade time to time  hr-employees are staying far and travelling too much everyday.	work
way towards the gate is too dusty; would be great if we can put a small pathway.	work
the layout of documents could be improved and autorating are missing to handle ces /ses more sufficient and easy..suprised that this has not been arranged prior programm is going live ..	work
disappointed is an understatement.	work
need to be more flexible to work with staff and find them useful roles	work
[company] has a very conservative working policy.	work
would appreciate if immediate superior check with us if we can take in additional work load, and not just mandate it without asking.	work
i feel like there should be more openness within the organisation.	work
making more comfortable	work
please make employees feel comfortable in working and in worship.	work
i want more flexible working time shift.	work
to provide more safety & comfortable workplace to colleagues.	work
working at [company] is very frustrating, i do not enjoy doing my job or coming to work.	work
the only thing that i would like improved is the workspace.	work
i would like to see an improvement with the raises for employees that stay positive and show it through out the whole year and it shows in the job they perform.	work
need to move-in with bad smell and noises.	work
you never hear anything.	work
[company] is a very large company and it sometimes is difficult to navigate the system to extract information.	work
the only way one can get a raise now is to go out and come back with a letter offer.	work
so far everything is working good only the annual appraisal needs to be fair	work
people put their heart into their jobs and still get paid close to nothing but yet the company is doing so well.	work
must work much more on getting the staff we have want to stay!	work
sbr is always flat out, whilst others around appear to do as little as possible	work
nothing, at this stage everything is working well .	work
overall conditions are perfect.	work
machine were maintainced well.	work
create more convenient workspace and environment in office area	work
pay freezes, ending first choice that's what we get but they still get there's.	work
less politics, just let us get on with the job and provide the service without the need to justify everything multiple times.	work
it was a disappointment to hear that raises for the employees this year were not going to happen.	work
i know [company] is working on new systems	work
would be great if deserving employees could receive descent raise.i keep my desk current,help team mates, work ot as needed,don't complain.raises make you feel appreciated. keeps one from looking for other opportunity.you get what you pay for!!	work
ways to make the office a less stressful environment at times.	work
good job is noticed but not appreciated,sometimes hard work goes unnoticed.	work
many are working outside of their scope of work and experience.	work
there is always senior junior things on floor, junior new users are treated as hell.	work
job descriptions need to be clearly defined and employees should be asked whether they understand what is expected of them.	work
no adequate tool to work effectively etc.	work
there is no structure which makes it impossible to visibly see any future working as nothing to show you can be promoted.	work
all that just to show senior leadership that we are working good with less spendings.	work
if you can improve the equipment we working with in the working place , we all can work much better.	work
he very often using his phone, don't helping us, is coming late to work, works as little as possible, he benefits the company.	work
the first point is merely a speculation.	work
we have been saving money on some silly things, which only makes it harder for us to take good care of the goods.	work
i think that for now were doin good but we need to have more communication to get the job done faster.	work
our people need a wake up call.	work
i would like to see staffing improve.	work
it is very hard to continue to take on new tasks and not be rewarded by it.	work
there is too much work for too little people.	work
so many people work through their lunch and breaks because we are required to get everything completed on time and are questioned when it is not done.	work
we need more people to support us.	work
i feel overworked and underpaid.	work
unable to even take time off.	work
at this moment,i know of several people that are activley looking for a new job outside of the company due to no pay increases given this year.	work
hire some people with experience and who want to work.	work
we work hard and for the stations that performed, we should be rewarded.	work
although things cannot always be helped, they need to show empathy to what is going on in the group.	work
this place is strictly politics and a chess game.	work
for me, working with an environment that [company] have is almost comfortable.	work
just one thing that there's a few thing needs to consider such as, technicalities.	work
i hope the atmosphere will be relax and vivid in workplace/office.	work
loyal people sometimes loose the passion and energy to continue in the organization and leave for better offers.	work
the atmosphere is fraught, team members have more work than they can deal with.	work
not an enjoyable place to work in.	work
since office move atmosphere has changed a little not sure of reasons why but hopefully will improve in the future.	work
hope we have enough time to completed rfq.	work
every thing seems working well.	work
there seems to be a culture of non commitment to taking the extra step people spend more time telling you how they can not help you than actually helping or trying to resolve things.	work
more job knowledge of other department	work
"sometimes a ""hand's on"" mentality seems to work best."	work
as a staff we are not get fair pay for same position, as working environment for different nationality as not so much satisfied  or more diversified environment should be create.	work
we were asked to give suggestions after last years survey, this was things the company could improve on, none of the suggestions given by my team were actioned, so i don't see why we should have to give them this year.	work
we llp are doing a fantastic job so far and we think continuous improvement is very important for keep up good work.	work
planners don't know how many people are going to travel and we are asked number of ppl who will be travelling wid	work
at this moment everything is fine	work
everyone should work in a team.	work
so far i am not seeing anything going wrong everything in line.	work
we need more people to improve our processes and be able to take a step back and see what can be changed.	work
we've lost many good employees to better paying jobs.	work
( al tayer was giving 10years ,also stopped.	work
doing well enough so far	work
instead of having to touch a file 3-4 times to get the job done efficiently.	work
there needs to be more patience when new employees ask questions.	work
i feel many transferred calls irritate people.	work
there are no clear work insturctions.	work
for me, almost everything here in dafza is good.	work
supervisors should get to work on time like all others are expected.	work
they never work properly and i can hardly understand the i.t.	work
get with the times	work
we need to look at our accounts and make them less complicated.	work
it would be helpful to be able to know where to go with a customer's questions.	work
to train more the people in terms of scope work/task, specially the new hired.	work
always do the best to keep our leadership in ff market	work
we really need to work on our business intelligence tools.	work
everyone has done the cif training, i'm yet to see some improvements happening especially on employees been motivated and been proactive with their work	work
everything seems to be working pretty well	work
should support the staffs all the way if is right  .	work
that make us difficult to get the rate fast.	work
i would like to know if there is any chance working overseas with [company],  i think that for outstanding employee performance should be given change for working outside country.	work
active in applying skills learnt into the job.	work
make our service/performance good to great	work
they take far too much precious time and attention.	work
we need more people in our  work force.	work
work loads need to be properly apportioned .	work
system tech - cargowise cannot come fast enough.	work
i am very happy in my job and very proud working for the company, the only improvement i would like to see is the very little hand full of people being so negative and just expect the company to give and always complain on everything even though no	work
none so far,  i have not spent much time to pick up negative vibes from the company/my team	work
the quality in our job, nevertheless we have been doing good things, it is important that everyone understand the need working well and at the first time.	work
we all need to strive to do things to the best of our ability.	work
we need to make sure we are all totally focused on the customer and using every opportunity to speak to them directly.	work
everything is going well and we just need to keep this continue.	work
work flow not balancing among the team.	work
we need more man power to get the job done, we are short here in jfk, we need to get better communication between each other , we need a lot more training in different positions.	work
i do not care to comment for fear of retribution	work
i believe that there needs to be more understanding on my end as to what my supervisors are expecting of me.	work
so far, it has gone unnoticed.	work
i enjoy change but this is one time where it's hurting more than helping.	work
they act like when we lose accounts they have no iead why.	work
i do not feel as though my opinion on the most effective way to do my job is valued.	work
bringing back previous employees with experience/knowledge is a foot in the right direction.	work
"in the pursuit of ""simplification"", we sometimes make things more complicated."	work
i never thought i'd say, i miss the centralized info of coin.	work
i have seen many changes done in the organization and these all are very good and useful for us.	work
we can work more towards organizing process.	work
i think many of the workforce do not understand why decisions are taken or how things are measured and so often are confused.	work
job security and review of salary on employee	work
everything is going smoothly but there is much scope for extra miles.	work
staff to be noticed for what they have done, not to look into kpis which is a system generated result rather than monitoring the real work staff is performing.	work
all is fine thanks	work
we also need to put the right people in the right positions to get better results from them.	work
i think improvement needs to be continuous and not just because a survey or an evaluation is coming up, changes need to stay and i feel that even though we are receiving some things, others have been taken from us, without taking our opinions into consideration.	work
need more training relative to our job	work
-salary, i think we deserve much more.	work
actions to improve obvious weak points	work
other [company] depot need to improve there work loads as i find  other offices seem to take the blunt of the work	work
for 17 years i give the best of me to this group	work
remove a lot more racking and give us room to do our job.	work
again this goes back to not having the right equipment to do our job right and quicker !	work
get rid of [name] !!	work
every thing looks up to date me	work
there are too many things from my perspective.	work
for example as a spot quoter, we need to win as much business as possible, and it will result in manual hawb entry.	work
having the people to cover all the work that is overwhelming the few people covering a department.	work
have the right people and skills in the right place	work
still working to get all of our processes down in work instructions.	work
management has good talking points and say the right things but many times do not follow through with their words or plans.	work
make sure information on cop's are correct  try to answer every phone call/email  making sure bills are being sent to customers	work
i think im satisfied for the work of our management	work
it will be a great help for us.	work
in my organisation, there is a gap between the [company] way of doing things and the way things are done here.	work
set a goal and wok on it continuously with a easy and reasonable way.	work
working as one company / network.	work
how to be pair to anyone	work
we still need a clear instruction for the work to anticipate over lapping work, instruction.	work
nothing is special.	work
seems like a lot of people like to carry on loud conversations most of the day, thus distracting others from working.	work
we need to focus on our work to get the job done and in a timely manner.	work
there's nothing worse than picking up the slack of unmotivated individuals.	work
that every one take responsibility of the work, the  schedules more of all at weekends that is when is short time.	work
where on function ends and the other starts, so there is a guide line, we work as a team but there is  huge gap on who is responsible for what, you end up doing everything yourself to get the job done	work
other departments need to take responsibility for their direct jobs and work harder to meet their targets instead of making excuses everytime they missed kpi's.	work
each and everyone always play a critical and important role, everyone should practice do it correct first time.	work
we tend to work without a plan, or assume too much in the way of continues improvement	work
all the team members must take a responsibility for every single thing/shipment that they are doing.do not take a mistake like a small issue and the mistake will repeating again without any improvement.	work
same drive is not coming from everyone.	work
the right manpower to get the job done.	work
communication with my direct report does not appear to be working as i feel that i am singled out for reasons unknown.	work
others work fast to get the work done in a short amount of time.	work
we are a team working together to make our customers happy at the end of the day and so we must take initiative when some things go wrong instead of pushing blames on people.	work
we need to know who is our direct report and each and everyone of us need to have their job description.	work
it is extremely discouraging and a bad habit at [company].	work
our team knows what needs to be done to complete our daily tasks	work
focus on the complete job and doing the little things 'right' the first time.	work
the environment is not professional, there is bad language.	work
nothing right now	work
we need to know what each one in our team's job is!	work
this would then able to attain great team work to execute the project more smoothly.	work
i don't have anything extra to comment in this point.	work
i miss action and getting the things done.	work
as of now everything is working fine.	work
nothing comes to mind	work
nothing in my department	work
i have nothing to add	work
need more stuff, too much pressure is being put on staff we have asked for help but instead are left to deal with the work load and struggle as other projects take priority.	work
ind projects need to stop running before they can walk.	work
i have felt like no one knows what they are doing.	work
the gsc need work, some of there responses when jobs are entered are absolutely reidiculous !	work
nothing to report	work
team work, communication, what is expected of the team/being told individually where we are going wrong.	work
surely with over 13 people leaving just this year shows an unhappy and unmotivated sales force	work
i have not been with the company very long so i have no comments to make here.	work
there should be a clear direction, once and for all, so that everyone can fully focus on his job.	work
there is no point in making any comments as i don't believe any thing communicated here makes any difference.	work
nothing at this point.	work
we need to hire people who are willing to learn and do the job given without question.	work
nothing at this time.	work
werehouse assistant do it hardworking.werehouse assistant geting less salary we need ingreement.we need two days off.	work
the reason we have lost some people has been because of that.	work
in my part as a carpenter, i need to improve my working place the access to complete and enough tools and equipment	work
i hope you will listen our concerns.	work
in my account i want to improved about that droping of pikcs.	work
i suppose if i was to pick anything that needs to improved i would say the salaries, as i see it the only time people seem to leave this great company is for more money.	work
i would like to see more social nights out with staff.	work
i think the current set-up is wrong.	work
i find it disheartening	work
all is ok from my point of view.	work
i worry a bit about getting rid of the phones and only using skype - if the internet connection goes down, there would be nothing else to fall back on, even alerting it would be difficult without a working phone system as a backup.	work
nothing to add	work
are we able to ensure we employ people who will be loyal to the company.	work
ems does not seem to be a focus anymore.	work
there are a lot of things that need be improved .	work
nothing that i can think of	work
bring people closer to trust that actual actions/decisions taken are really in line with co.	work
for me the maybe the air condition needs to improve.	work
nothing as such everything in going well, i want to continue it.	work
as salary is one of the main reason that people leave this organization and opt for something out of [company].	work
we cant expect any promotions in the company	work
our it system but i know [company] is working on this	work
feeling good to work here.	work
appreciation an appraisals should be very fair because this is something that motivates an employee to stay and work hard but it also turns a hardworking employee to change his/her attitude towards work (now i just dont care type of attitude)	work
listening to the people on the desks understanding their challenges, i think a lot of the ops teams get bad press but in some cases it is the management structure that causes the damage and unrest, we need to listen and hear what they are saying.	work
management must stop to use bias to consider the promotion, open mind to listen more; reduce ego; if not, how many year we do eos?	work
the supervisor [name] is expecting us to do his work and demotivates us even though we complete the project on time and quality of deliverable is good.	work
i think every thing is ok.	work
i think every thing is ok.	work
it requests do takes a lot of time.	work
nothing i can think about	work
1 need to think those guys those are working in low level like warehouse assistant,  about there needs, not only high people coz, the guys are working wh or low level they are our real heroes	work
i'm tired of hearing we're broke, please share more on what we all can do to make us more financially sound.	work
however, once one mistake happen we will not get any bonus & increament which i feel not fair need to be review again	work
support to get the job done right not just fast	work
giving employees a chance to voice their opinion and what works for them instead of making changes without knowing what works .	work
this is not a safe work environment.	work
nothing to add	work
i can not tell what needs to be improved yet, because i work here for only four months.	work
i can hardly find something.	work
no enough labor force to conduct such scope of work  3.	work
because of this i have seen lot of people leaving.	work
arrangement of quality necessities in such situation is important and shows the care company takes for its employee.	work
hope to have more flexible working hours eg.	work
8.00am - 5.00pm or 8.30am - 5.30pm as some parents are rushing back from work to fetch their kids.	work
whereas we see new comers coming on a higher pay with no experience.	work
i am still waiting to see that the company/managers see who really are hard working trust worthy employees.	work
some department/people have less work, others are very busy  so, thee work has to be divided properly.	work
do you really think it fair.	work
thats what made this place a bonus to work at and try as hard as you can.	work
nothing as concern.everything working well as the commitments are kept.	work
not enough lighting for some position	work
many people are leaving because you can live comfortable with the money you make here.	work
we have too much work and not enough people	work
i think overall everyone does an excellent job at their daily tasks at hand!	work
job security.	work
why even say anything if it's not happening?	work
a lot of us are totally overwhelmed with all of the items assigned to us and put in many extra hours a week.	work
unbais leadership; equal opportunity and stop with the good old boy club.	work
investment in a better office space & environment.	work
when people doing a great job: that needs to show in pay raises (company losses/gains back and forth)or upward movement for them, or they start looking elsewhere.	work
corporate cuts people so routinely that we are forever afraid of being fired.	work
our it is still not good.	work
one raise for everyone makes your best people feel like their extra efforts are not noticed.	work
nothing at this time	work
not fair when one is confronted about something but it is ok for the other to do.	work
you're going to hear this a lot from my team.	work
at the moment it is hard for me to point at something that is not working well.	work
i'm disappointed with the salary i'm receiving to the company.	work
they just throw them like nothing.	work
if you ask them they can answer almost everything.	work
newcomers get what they deserved.	work
at the moment nothing.	work
sometimes i feel like it is the hierarchy that is stopping our flexibilities and willingness to do better.	work
overall doing a great job	work
not too sure as of yet	work
nothing to add.	work
the alibility or option to work from home.	work
people losing access to certain things.	work
nothing in my area	work
i still feel that there some employees who feel that they can smoke when they want to or refer to management and get their way.	work
training hp department in india so they know how to exactly do their job.	work
the dress-code policy needs to be properly enforced.	work
nothing to add	work
none as of the moment.	work
customer feedback difficult to find the contact number.	work
help employees to feel valued.	work
create a productive atmosphere.	work
we will feel demotivated in certain degree if the budget is too difficult to reach even though we tried all we can.	work
every things is good for me,	work
please block recruiting those people because relatives workers are not doing a good job.	work
overall good without further supplement	work
the time to get things appoved	work
no set work schedule and comes and goes.	work
i believe training new employees needs to be improved because we come into a company knowing absolutly nothing and get thrown into situations we have to figure out ourselves.	work
i think everything is okay the way it is	work
the primary piece of software i need to do my job was to be sundowned with nfe.	work
working equipment, non union personal attitudes thinking they know everything when they don't, hr is terrible nothing resolved, co stalling with union contact not willing to pay the most experienced employees what they deserve and it's well deserved	work
in order to get the job done, i have to consistently work 10-12 hour days.	work
the basic sallery is very low cmpare to other organizatins .need improvement on our basics	work
thanking for all the good things that had happened in our company last year and before that, request you to look into our basic pays.	work
i am happy with my work environment	work

we have to much people on sick leave	work
for how great logis system is and how much you can do with it there is always some issues with understandng it.	work
it is not user-friendly an hard to discover new featurs by yourself.	work
some people could  give away more knowledge to new people	work
"we use to have a one point entry and now it is demotivating to ""just sit and wait"" for a solution that are often too late."	work
we need urgently air condition for our offices.	work
everybody is just as miserable if not more than last year.	work
giving the right tools to the employee to do their job	work
from my point of view everything is at its best..	work
as far as i now all is well.	work
cif training really helped improve how we can work together as a team to achieve almost anything.	work
"1)you cannot ""earn"" something at [company] even if you have worked hard, long and dedicated."	work
being a big company can be a hindrance to getting things done quickly.	work
nothing to add	work
nothing to add	work
mind setup.	work
doing right thing with combined effort is very important.	work
as i am new staff here, i would like to have more activities to get know well of all my colleagues.	work
everythings is superb in this company, but the only thing the senior managemnt looks down and ignores its employees is when it comes to salaries.	work
they need to take care of team , front end customers , handle files , take part in projects without any form of motivation	work
there should be some alternate that the other person (buddy) will  not get annoyed to do his or her work.	work
as such everyone is accupied with their own work through out the day	work
all are going well	work
systems should be working well....upgraded time to time	work
call is too noisy in an open environment	work
not enough characters to explain point.	work
it is need to our company for right person in right position.i think some postion is ocupied by some wrong people.	work
we need more people	work
some people do a whole of of work and extra work, while some just take their time to do non-work relating things.	work
all is going well till now	work
do focus on this, if people are happy we get kpi numbers automatically.	work
if you come to work and you enjoy the atmosphere.	work
i'm not saying play around but it you work in a more relaxed environment you work harder and more efficiently than if you dread coming in	work
user get time to do other things to leave days.	work
everything is going good as far as now...	work
i can see a lot of nepotism going around, for e.g.	work
people getting promoted without undergoing ijp.	work
the managers only feel like conducting a meeting when eos is around the corner.	work
everything is working well.	work
email what we are getting from we care for job position need to be clearly circulate with the employees and also what are the things need to required for given designation ....	work

all is going well.	work
nothing all is good.	work
every thing is so cool as of now :)	work
no comments, all going good.	work
the time between things that are told are happening, to the time that they actually happen.	work
i would like more team work across departments, there tends to be times we work against each other.	work
perhaps to ensure this is done	work
i'm fairly new with the company.	work
surely, we are under paid and that yet we do a lot of work because we are 2 in my department .	work
i do not have in mind the idea for this topic	work
generate a family environment between colleagues.	work
i know it's a bit difficult because we all have the right to have free feelings but it's not impossible, as this is the place where we stay most part of the time.	work
our supervisor does not give us room for errors/mistakes always telling us never to make mistake otherwise we will be issued w/ warning letter, which is really demotivating us.	work
the atmosphere at the office should be improved because in the back parts it's too cold and it's uncomfortable during the work day.	work
pre-payment, the service is not very good in comparison to the previous.	work
professional environment should not be the place for people to demonstrate and feed their ego and play games.	work
believe that much could be gained from such.	work
i have nothing specific to add	work
right now we need info abt the future in regards to location, which causes a lot of distress.	work
toilettes on site are mostly dirty.	work
working conditions can be improved significantly.	work
from my point of view every thing working perfectly.	work
employee should fell that their jobs is secured	work
people need to stay off the phones and do there work  to many people think its social hour.	work
world peace, my next bowel movement, my traps, people keep getting away ;p there also should be a law for stupid people in the warehouse house, were we can just hit them or run them over, i'm not fussy.	work
wages - looking at other job adverts i'm very under paid for the job that i do, including the other responsibilities i have taken on my own accord.	work
would be nice to get a promotion so my job title suits the job i do - as i do feel overlook and a little undervalued	work
leave me to do my job	work
of do it a good job	work
the additional financial can be better utilized to hire more resources to better support our job.	work
i think the request it site could be improved.	work
nothing at this time.	work
1) information flow is slow and often has holes in the bigger picture.	work
2)the computers we are given are not fast enough or reliable enough to maximize some of our efficiency.	work
it is hard to give your all to a job when you are constantly stressed about making ends meet and paying bills.	work
we are running on mimuial people.	work
we do a great job on working through it where we can.	work
sometimes i do not feel we are recognized for all our hard work.	work
working environment,it's too noisy and loudest culture	work
a more lively working environment.	work
but the weight of the job, how they manage it.	work
sore backs at the end of a shift as well as small monitors make it harder to work when you have bad eyes focusing on old screens	work
nothing as such, all seems fine as of now.	work
everything is working good.	work
colleagues attitude must be changed  everyone should do his work in a proper way  to check who is working & who is not	work
i cannot advise of anything at this moment in time	work
we need more people in department, would like to have a shift-partner.	work
i do not get nothing extra for working without any sick day each year.	work

i am bale to communicate with any problems to my supervisor and he is able to help find a solution.	work
this place could run itself if management would let it but they have to micromanage everything.	work
employees know their jobs and how best to do them but our dispatch seems to think they know better than the ones who have done it.	work
we do the  best to get a job done .	work
it is a friendly and worm working environment.	work
cfs has done a good job in letting us know about the company as a whole along with our place in the organization.	work
communication about the daily things that need to get done to make us a great truck line.	work
"maybe streamline some of what is communicated because i think that it can become just ""white noise"" after a while"	work
most drivers are willing to work excessive hours in order to get the job done.	work
everything is ok ... i think	work
my manager is inspiring us every day and is motivating us to do our job with more creativity.	work
we need more people to work, we are the minimum people to work and that is a serious problem.	work

responsiveness from ocean departments.	employees
convention and trade show attendance and exhibiting bans, lift them.	employees
there still seems to be a lack of urgency for the customer, both external and internal and zero accountability with the above listed teams.	employees
to enable desk level agents to communicate more frequently with the customers, certain other day to day tasks need to be removed.	employees
hse needs high attention in the me region as our customers are getting more and more hse conscious.	employees
inter department unity.	employees

the flexibility we have to engage with customers & colleagues to find solutions and gain new biz would be helpful to have a guide on companies we need auth to work with	customer
from my view customer service plays one of most critical elements for our success.	customer
we don't focus on customer needs.	customer
more insistence on quality and customer centric attitude at the station level	customer
ops needs a lot improvement they look for kpi achievement and miss customer commitment.	customer
service to the customer	customer
service quality at large us stations/gateways do not meet customer expectations.	customer
the service we are providing, it seems we have to make changes at the stations to improve our services and provide a better response and service to the clients.	customer
closer attention to customers	customer
managing internal relationships takes away from paying attention to customers.	customer
we need to look at better practices and look at how we can ensure excellent service to customers.	customer
full implementation and understanding of new customers requirements prior to commencement of working relationship to ensure we gain customer trust from very first shipment we handle.	customer
less impetus on kpis and more focus on feedback from the customer - that is the most important kpi.	customer
become more customer centric instead of internal/product centric  accountability (less discussion)	customer
customer service and operational ownership of performance levels	customer
our reporting systems are another big point: they need to deliver more quality.	customer
both these issues are barriers to improving customer relationships and business growth	customer
- ownership is missing at operational team to solve issues in a proper way  - our product reacts slowly for the the market trends and not customer oriented	customer
hiring of better talent in countries to support business projects and change  continued focus on better customer engagement and service	customer
more alignment within the team before interacting with customers and better data quality will help us to continue improving our customer experience/perception.	customer
we have started our journey to become more customer focused but i believe we could do more of and highlight that whatever we do it is our customers that need to benefit.	customer
[company] sells their customers our service without knowing what we do.	customer
invest in quality and compensation, especially for our employees who make the difference with regard to quality and service excellence	customer
we need understand what customer's concern and improve our service	customer
there should be continuous improvement process on the customer service.	customer
want company to improve quality services to employees.	customer
(lacks the drive to provide the best service to the high revenue customer.)	customer
(particularly due to increased number of life science customers,the standard of capas must be improved)	customer
as an inplant, the customer views us as their workforce.	customer
while we work hard to deliver the best possible service to our customers,it seems that not all the other [company] offices we work with share the same goal.	customer
it would be great to have a corporate plan to support and maintain our most important clients - due to we are a network.	customer
we do not focus enough on out customers.	customer
we need more back up to provide an even better service level to our clients	customer
strategy to gain more customers,	customer
business customers need more relevance in our system, currently bc is the highest priority on all management discussions but at the ground level the priorities are completely different and is treated as a customer who is not important.	customer
all the functions across [company] need to be more customer centric and take ownerships.	customer
more concentration when the customer gives comments of our services.	customer
customer centricity is missing.	customer
customers service levels are based on the size of the customers thouh all customer is importnant to us.	customer
basic level of service is also missing and custombers are suufring due to this.	customer
we need to be able to be more flexible to offer customized solutions & processes to align to a customers requirements	customer
we need to have a customer service support from the locally this will help increase our customer base.	customer
i think sometimes within operations / customer service we are still not giving the customer full attention and responsiveness in certain areas or in certain circumstances.	customer
implementation of new business  operational ownership of new & existing  business  timely responses to customers  churn - allow tsms to look after business  more characters needed for this box	customer
company service levels and attitude	customer
ownership of customers and files can improve in hayes.	customer
creating a culture of customer centricity	customer
action within the bu's to drive good business practice  customer focus  employee focus	customer
customer centricity, sales and business development, future strategy.	customer
we currently serve 3-4 major customers who form 60-70% of our overall business.	customer
to ensure the high level of quality and service we need to start	customer
held more customer service training, efficient communication & courtesy with customer.	customer
getting every one to see the big picture  we must provide the customer with our best services.	customer
it is required to satisfy the customer.	customer
this area should be improved as we are offering services and the quality that we are providing to our customers are stake because we focus more on productivity and not the quality.	customer
flexibility of service to customer	customer
this is the customers choice but i do not feel the customer is getting a quality service.	customer
customer service on the air import department needs improvement in providing customer accurate information.	customer
our overall system is far behind our competition- this is consistently being brought to my attention by customers.	customer
need to focus more and understand the customer requirements for a smooth operations in order to gain more business from them.	customer
need to do more homework to provide better and quality services to the customers.	customer
we haven-t reached yet customer centricity.	customer
we need more operational staff to be able to provide better service to our customers.	customer
not enough time to follow up on customers	customer
implementation needs to be more focused and right processes needs to be followed so that all stakeholders are well aware of customer requirements and dynamics to ensure consistent customer delight at all times.	customer
the flow of how we provide services to customers needs to be improved on.	customer
personally , especially when it comes to new customers , we need to fully engage until the very end ( invoicing ).	customer
i lost 3 customers so far due to faults from our side.	customer
we need to work hard on our customer service which is horrible.	customer
service quality- customer service and operations(quick response time)  competitive rates	customer
i understand that market has been unstable these days, however, we as a team being in front of customers, feel we have been against the market.	customer
more focus on our business rather to internal matters.	customer
need to align customer requirements with business practices, we are spending too much time on non-value add services but not enough on value add services (or set-up / implementation)	customer
- customer facing it systems  - more file/customer ownership in ops  - improved internal reporting to reduce workload in csu  - more focus on servicing bc customers  - increase investment in equipment (i.e.	customer
greater focus on the customer and all people in the company thinking of themselves as being in customer service and sales.	customer
focusing on improving our customer service skills and prioritising communication with the customer.	customer
customer satisfaction + entertain the customer	customer
quality of team leaders  responsiveness to customer issues	customer
i understand that customer expect more & more quality service from forwarders.to be honest, i found that our global system have not yet  friend with user.	customer
quality of customer service and process of [company] are good.	customer
improve customer focus especially with nominate or small size customer.	customer
still many issues throughout the network in regards to customer focus	customer
overall customer centricity & quality is being focused but still it requires more attention.	customer
need to further improve our service quality according to customers requirement and as per changing world,	customer
need to focus on customer care and operations satisfaction.	customer
to simplify the process for customer's satisfaction	customer
regarding overseas customer service quality, there is a much gap between the country where they can give excellent service and not ones.	customer
i would like to improve overseas customer service quality which less quality country can provide with.	customer
1) resolve customer's problem more efficiently.	customer
we still need to ensure continuous improvement in our transport delivery/collection performance in order to meet customerâs expectations and satisfaction.	customer
prompt update on ofd & pod when customer delivery has been completed.	customer
our service quality is not good enough and has no proper channel for customer to feedback our service issue.	customer
ownership or sense of belonging still needs to be improved, not all employees have the same customers' orientation.	customer
we are service company, need to develop our human resource in order to give high level of service quality & top management need to improve the internal process especially on cs function	customer
follow through and pro-activeness in our customer service to customer's request.	customer
voc is to be focused in passing on the passion in embarking towards a customer orientated environment.	customer
we need to work towards getting the best customer experience.	customer
mindset change: need to me more entrepreneurial; more candid attitude in response to customer's requirements.	customer
operation efficiency: too complex which provides no flexibility to meet customer requirements.	customer
work as one team to be real customer centric and improve product(strong pricing team), service quality, it system to differentiate us from other competition.	customer
if we can manage customer expectation which defines fulfilling customer experience.	customer
offer too much to customer but getting too less from her	customer
the customers feel that customer service team is overworked.	customer
customer service and operations.	customer
we never put the customer first.	customer
as a new employee to [company], i have not seen a commitment to customer service or customer satisfaction from some of the supporting product teams.	customer
additional trained staff, sense of urgency & ownership, eliminate redundancy, continue with improving the customer experience and our service quality	customer
service we provide to the customer is extremely poor	customer
the customer needs to see more customer service from [company]>[company] does the best we can, but we need more people customer facing.	customer
we have a problem servicing our business customers.	customer
we still need stronger operational and customer service support to support our customers.	customer
ownership by customer service for the customer.	customer
ownership of customer communication from operations could be improved, both with updating the customer on transit and service issues.	customer
servicing business customers, when it comes to air and ocean import operations, brokerage and customer service.	customer
we need to put the focus on being customer centric with operational kpi's tied to customer satisfaction and growth vs internally focused measurements that are far removed from the customers experience.	customer
more power to customer service to meet the customer's needs.	customer
i feel we need be more customer friendly and our actions should be more focused towards customer urgency .	customer
proactive customer service  reliable operations functioning all the time every time	customer
employee responsiveness to customer requests is slow/non-existent.	customer
better proactive providing of information to customers  focus on hiring quality at entry-level ops for optimal results  in collections team is source of customer complaint,not help	customer
customer follow up.	customer
the customer service department should be reinstated so that all our customers can be given a more personlised service this would allow our sales team to get out on the road and get more business instead of being bogged down with admin after a visit	customer
we need to find more business solutions in the area and offer to our clients.	customer
in the netherlands we are going through a rough period which impacts the customer satisfaction and quality of service.	customer
quality of service and customer focus is not as it should be at the moment.	customer
our csu need to take more care and be more compassionate with our customers, especially when things go wrong.	customer
customer service needs to come back under and report to sales locally to ensure closer working relationship & avoid us/them.	customer
a return to basic service levels at real effective cost.	customer
transparency to the customer.	customer
receive lots of complains from customers about service.	customer
customer centricity and service quality.	customer
overall customer service is good.	customer
clients are not felling good and as company like [company] customer service attitude must be changed.	customer
need to make sure the responding time to the customer faster.	customer
which is a continuous issue we received from customer.	customer
customer service towards the customer experience and do the right thing at first time to minimize operational error.	customer
need to improve the customer service and some time we are facing problem with client due to attitude.	customer
need to improve the customer service level and attitude with the clients by the customer service.	customer
communication gap between customer service and clients which effecting the volume.	customer
we need to focus on customer demand more and  quality should be better align with global changing .	customer
i think, relation with customers is need to make more strong.	customer
thatâs how we can achieve more business from existing customers.	customer
it's great experience for customer centricity & quality.	customer
most customer think that [company] has over customer.	customer
sales support efficiency & speed at giving rates  2.	customer
in where i work some vendors are giving bad service, we need to review vendors in order to meet customer satisfication	customer
focus on customer satisfaction in the decisions made by sales.	customer
we need to compete with the local competition in terms of rates and value added services	customer
i think we need to relook on the quality of service we provide to our customer.	customer
there are still many communication gap between our customer service and customer.	customer
yes, we are all focussed to become the most customer centric logistics co, but for that all the internal departments like cs/ ops/ sales/ cnc needs to work in co-ordination with the cos.	customer
customer retention needs to improved.	customer
what is committed to customer , needs to be delivered,	customer
customer satisfaction need to improve regarding services	customer
there are a lot of initiatives takes with customer centricity and quality improvement but again there is no concrete plan to achieve the real customer satisfaction or wow !!!	customer
we need to be more on customer service approach	customer
we more focus our service of quality to improve our customer centric.	customer
1) focus to improve services for customer should be improved through actions instead of words.	customer
customer need basics service like recd shipment and docs on time, which must be improved.	customer
customer centricity and quality	customer
some very pro-active and customer minded, but there still seems some saff that cs should do only what is said and focus on only work effeciency which leads to complaint from customer and burden sls.	customer
customer service and operations need to wow the customer	customer
we are moving away from being customer centric.	customer
we need to be more customer centric and be little flexible and not to go in too many procedure.	customer
resources/manpower to be given for handling customers in quality way	customer
we need to give more exlent services to our customer  and high qulity..	customer
simplified structured focusing on the customer	customer
simple processing and delivery by using the service then may get the satisfaction	customer
on my opinion we need more value added services, such as visibility, tracking and quotation tools to compete in the market.	customer
i thinks as a âservice companyâ we must take some steps towards customer service and how we can improve our quality in customers experience.	customer
we need to focus more efforts on improving customer experience.	customer
we should really find the right path on improving csv and making customers stay longer with us.	customer
npa program is reaching the customer to ease their concerns and allow us to fix any problems.	customer
need to improve approach toward daily customer work, presentations and communication.	customer
important to respect deadlines and constantly be looking for new/better ways to serve the customer	customer

cooperation at station level for added value services and understanding of the added value service and benefits corporate level.	customer
we need to keep improving to provide more satisfaction to the client.	customer
in order to deliver quality to customer as within my group some countries must make same investment in people concerning to their workload and quality performance.	customer
global entrepreneurship needs to improve, we should focus on innovative support services across the network that helps our internal customers, the stations.	customer
this would then release time for them to focus more on the customer locally.	customer
we have too many bespoke (manual) reports towards our customers.	customer
more communication with the client.	customer
the customer service view of customer.	customer
i'm not suggesting we offer poor customer service, rather, that this is an area we should always strive to improve upon as we are a service provider and by definition our product is our people and our customers will come back because of quality cs	customer
staff must have clearly defined service to offer the customer.	customer

sales force and strategy, customer focus and extra care  to be improved.	customer
the hard work and efforts of people should be always recognized by the superiors and at least some initiatives should be taken to satisfy the employees, employees satisfaction is that important as customer satisfaction.	customer
it's more quantity over quality, and in my beliefs this is not beneficial for staff and customers.	customer
employee engagement will improve our employees feeling pride and loyalty working for our organization, to our clients, users and customers, going the extra mile to finish a piece of work and improve our product and services.	customer
we need to retain & reward our long term committed staff	customer
giving more opportunities to long service staff to develop themself for better future/position.	customer
ownership of customers at all levels needs to be improved.	customer
customer experience has long way to go.	customer
ms office usage, cargo insurance 4) some departments have inertia to change for better service quality e.g.	customer

we are always one employee deep towards a service failure.	customer
more continued efforts to gain back customers in stations where they were lost due to nfe.	customer
i feel regional senior leadership lacks the willingness to listen to employees and supervisors concerns on the operation to improve or protect processes	customer
"[company] is focused on winning external customers; however, not focused on ""winning"" internal customers."	customer
company focuses entirely on long term business and big customers ignoring spot market customers.	customer
majority of the people in this company are not focused.	customer
better engagement with customers about [company] products.	customer
synergy between departments, strategical services for the customer, customer trust towards the b.u., the important of b.u. for [company] global, search of skilled personal, feeling of belonging to [company].	customer
there is alway room for improvement going forward to keep a good working enviroment and provided good customer service for our customers	customer
if we are customer focused we need to focus on the customer and not waste time on completing kpi's and other items that do not directly impact the customer just to make up the numbers.	customer
we need to be more simple internally as well as facing the customer.	customer
clear corporate structures, speeding up decision-making processes, improving quality, courses, training, development opportunities, employee motivation, valuing employees, customer orientation, stronger cooperation with business units.	customer
"now it is a new kpi called ""conversion rate"" that is leading to major cost cuttings in indirect functions."	customer

customer engagement, put more respect and time to listen to our customers.	customer
it systems and equipments, to support our processes and operations, resulting in excellence service to our customers	customer
focus of our company has to change to external.	customer
management has to take count on the customer satisfaction toward the sla before reducing or increasing head counts so we can continue the good service level.	customer
perhaps more creative strategies and out of the box solutions to gain an advantage over competitors when quoting services.	customer
need improve our service time by time .	customer
our core application is supported by a vendor that has little interest in our success and does not partner with us.	customer
a better way to wheel in new customers without losing revenue.	customer
it is good to hear about customer centricity.	customer
[company] need to review all positions which are not customer facing in order to provide a lean organisation.	customer
customer service (both frontline and backline, all products)  3.	customer
customer service and workplace need improvement.	customer
1, processes need to be simplify; eg: shpt go via gwt  2, staff turnover is high in this year due to productivity or other cost concern, it might have more or less impact on service quality.	customer
operation and customer service have to be improved to the level what key account managers are currently doing so that we can convert kay account manager to business development rather than solving problem of daily issue.	customer
more stable and streamline company structure may help working more efficiently.	customer
we are not acquiring new customers and there seems to be little focus in doing so	customer
our productivity targets, while a very key gauge, do not reflect what is actually needed to service our customers and to deliver excellence.	customer
need to better equip customer service and ops to handle new customers before securing more volume.	customer
customer service, employee expectation, realistic job responsibilities, ease of communication, business continuity plan and remove the uncertainty.	customer
customer service as a whole.	customer
[company] needs to invest in new technology and innovation when it comes to providing the necessary shipment entry and tracking tools to their employees.our sales team needs to also provide the customer with realistic service and transit times	customer

customer satisfaction level needs to be improved.	customer
sudden big change of company strategy make us confused and discouraged	customer
need to improve customers bill counts	customer
both parties look to outdo the other when they should be working together to provide the best opportunities for it's employe	customer
quick fix to improve finance is not always the right option, we are a service industry and need quality people in the right roles with enough time and support to innovate	customer
customer centricity and quality of service.this needs to come down from our topmost management as the single most important area of focus, and we empower people and also hold them accountable for delivering highest quality of service to our customers	customer
moreover there is no customer service solutions once new business is obtained.	customer
we win new customers but too many leave	customer
doesn't feel like the biggest challenges have changed (competitive pricing) and customer service (we cannot get any leaner, it is affecting customer service/ops ability to do their jobs)	customer
need to put a lot of effort to get more key customers after losing some very big customers this year.	customer
i believe the management is trying it's best to the best interest of it's employees.	customer
the future and strategy has to be discussed and employees also needs to be equipped due to shift market trends to serve our customers better..	customer
above is really effecting the business customer focus.	customer
we should have one system (operations, sales, customer service, accounting ...) or can be more but they must be connected with each other	customer
all service provider are out of control and not supportive.they no respect to any of [company] staff.	customer
leadership needs to provide services that todays customers are looking for and not just what they seem to be relevant to their personal ideas.	customer
strategy to attract new customers	customer
we need more customers for domestic and international to keep our business going	customer
allow the time we need to meet the expectations of our customers w/o having to leave at 8hr sharp, w/customer needs unfinished.	customer
need to stay with the plan as well as retain our quality people.	customer
to be in contact with the customers, and offer more services	customer
we need to be able to react faster to customer needs, through technology through new processes.	customer

more attention needed for employee's future.	customer
continuous development in our company for the satisfaction of employee.	customer
resource availability & continuity between internal customers	customer
we need more customer service dealing with our customers directly.	customer
people should listen to each other and realise that we all work towards same goals - better customer satisfaction and continuous company success.	customer
our company [company] should invest more in developing online applications and online platform for customers as well as employees which will bring both employees , customers and management to next level.	customer
more consideration ahead for customer.	customer
communication about new customers	customer
customer service do not call customer and depends on email communication.	customer
more people as customer service  agents.	customer
i feel this is a necessary part of serving our customers.	customer
support from stations need to improve to increase customer support and turn around time.	customer
comunication with other division and worldwide offices in oder to improve our services to customer	customer
we all need to be working as one team to reach our goals for better service to the customer.	customer
some of the communication to customers needs to improve, perhaps this is more related to training on how we deal with customers and issues	customer
each department should communicate better in order to deliver excellent service for customer.	customer

looking for efficient flow of communication from products to local kams.	customer
customer satisfaction by the way of improvement of it background of company.	customer
better communication between customer and instructions	customer
new customer implementation process needs to be quicker and more friendly to the customer to get them shipping asap.	customer
communication with the customers sometimes takes too long to be responded.	customer
very often i need to get involved to make sure the customer is being taken care of	customer
communication between operations and customer	customer
operations - we need more customer service actually reaching out to the customer by phone not depending on an email or [company] to service our customers.	customer
operation support  pricing  better communication among employees here in the us and overseas so we can offer customer clear and concise feedback so they can run their supply chain more effectively	customer
more clear and to the point information received to customer services about customer needs and requirement the better will be able to serve customer.	customer
- great communicate with customer  - warm up with customer when they need us  - keep the good relationship with them for more business  - full of responsible with our customer	customer
our customer service	customer
everyone should take care of customer requirements hence the same has to be communicated to everyone and act together to meet them.	customer
customer satisfaction is our moto.	customer
onboarding from one business unit to the other (better communication required of product / services / internal procedures relating to business unit)	customer
communication is vital amongst the different departments to have a successful business and therefore to give our customers the best possible service.	customer
[company] overall need to inform the clients.	customer
customers only see the [company] logo and think all offices are the same.	customer
our operational procedures to be of good standards, by retaining old customer.	customer

improvement in our services and communication with customers.	customer
communication through out all departments and transparency on what is happening and what will happen in the future.more training to be readily available to employees to help them improve themselves thus improving their performance for the company.	customer
whenever there is a problem, it seems that it is due to lack of communication among supervisor, customer service, processors, and warehouse.	customer
when the customer says [company], in their mind they have reached the company they need; we may not necessarily be able to supply or service	customer
customer will appreciate in fast replies and reverts.	customer
communication needs to be more efficient from overseas offices for us to provide stronger support to our customers.	customer
as a newcomer to [company] i feel embarrassed that l am unable to provide a better service to customers due to the lack of service received.	customer
-communication from the customer  -communication from other [company] offices.	customer
too many mistakes made, poor service & communication going back to the customer.	customer
hunting more business or customer for more job and more earnigs.creats  extra facilities for them those who weres seniors in this company.	customer
this counts for all departments to achieve a high quality service towards our customers.	customer
finding quality customers and improvement of store with qualified peoples	customer
customer communication  working better between teams/departments	customer
complex clients and their needs,  to much work for one person to do all by themselves  no back up people	customer
different divisions/departments must assist each other and create a single work flow for clients, whether its a controlled business or non-controlled business.	customer
this will help improve the company's relation with customers.	customer
there needs to be more communication so we can deliver the same service to our customers and standardize our procedures.	customer
we need the warehouse to provide good internal customer service so we can provide excellence to our customers.	customer
the team work between sales support and customer service team	customer
-our staff need to be more open to handling different customer requirements.	customer
the communication/flow between customer service and customs dept.	customer
it is responsibility of all us to meet customers and bring new business for our company/[company].	customer
i would suggest an improvement within the product and customer service department in terms of coordination.	customer
management to remind all staff to refrain from copying others in the email unnecessarily, this will improve company overall work efficiency	customer
need to improve in teamwork in order to satisfied customer's expectation	customer
team work is very importance to achieve the  goal and customer satisfaction.	customer
poor communication within team and across departments;  staff is not willing to share information for job security reason;  staff lack of curiosity to explore and lack of motivation to improve	customer
everyone should hold the responsibility to give customer satisfaction.	customer
internal communication need to be imporved, where any new added customer's potential, importance, key areas, nature of business, customer's expectations etc.	customer
timely updation to the customer on day to day activities,	customer
less focus on kpi's, meetings, trainings,etc..and more focus on servicing our customers.	customer
communication between operation/customer service need some work	customer
everyone is so busy and there is no sense of helping one another to best service the customers.	customer
we always work as a team to fulfill our customer requirements to make our customer happy	customer
service delivery should be improved because there is neglency  at most of the time by some staff	customer
we all one team , one family having the same goal to become our customers first choice and deliver the quality service .	customer
in our team we need to make sure that we have enough hands to take care of customers	customer
many of the departments are not worried about providing best customer experience.	customer
with this thought process, they only person that suffers is the customer.	customer
ap each country kam needs to work more closely together to make better customer satisfaction.	customer
an increase in employees would make a more positive impact in providing the customers the service in which is expected of us.	customer
we must continue to improve our internal customer service and enhance our commitment to our teams internally to overall improve our customers experience.	customer
communication with ourselves and customer's to provide an ensured quality service.	customer

i have to improve my self more in terms of customer service.	customer
to invest on job specific trainings focusing on operations, sales & customer service.	customer
with new pga it is rolled out and not many of understand what is needed to work with our customers.	customer
advising them to contact a oga department to me is not great customer service.	customer
i would say this will need some attention learning and devoplemnt	customer
basically in cs department , all is good , we only need to more learning about how to make customer happy and certify with our service.	customer
continuous and realistic training for our employees who handle customer service duties.	customer
"there need to be a training (not online)for all levels in the company to understand that we are in ""service industry"" and the importance what service means to the customer."	customer
more training for everyone in order to provide best service to all our customers	customer
i want more cause of the way to communicate and solve problem with customer to improve my ability and satisfy customer.	customer

we have been understaffed so long, that we are now failing to provide a decent service to our customers.	customer
[company] fails to provide acceptable technology that would allow us to provide better service.	customer
tat and service levels offered to customer should be practically possible and reasonable	customer
i wish to see the business increasing  improve the team work and have a better communication	customer
if the fuctions are split you can focus on the better quality service thus providing the clients with the right service they expect.	customer
to service the customer we would need more people.	customer
if not more people the time to service the customer without being stressed.	customer
the pay for the type of work and services we provide for our customers is not up to par with our counterparts from other companies.	customer
we need to retain our good employees.	customer
servicing customers is not more important than employee safety.	customer
this needs to improve as management see a lot in lateness of the staff.	customer
management is unhelpful and does not appreciate the talent pool, particularly in the billing department.	customer
monitoring everything, even though customer do not have complaints  it-laptops are old.	customer
it appears all the efforts are directed towards customers and reducing employee numbers.	customer

internal team to be improved in providing datas required by customer in a faster way inorder to satisfy customer	customer
to keep our customers we need to see them, a travel ban is not an encouraging sign for us or our customers.	customer
employees should be expanded so that we can have a control on volumes.	customer
increase more suppliers on truckers to enable serve our customers better.	customer
most of employees are working with same customer, same manager, same product for a long time.	customer
at operations level, logis is too much manual and we lose time instead of increasing time for customer service and results	customer
at times its embarrassing to bring vendors and or customers in.	customer
as today rfq have become more complicated and customer requirement are higher.	customer
from my personal opinion what needs to be improved is the number of clients, we need more clients for more income(funds)and company stability	customer
improving the quote process with its where responses are within 3 days and service costs are standardized.	customer
we need to demonstrate a higher level of expertise and technical knowledge to our customers; customer financial reporting capabilities; focus on qualification of opportunities that provide necessary pricing solutions to further win business	customer
systems must be improved and quickly as this has an impact on how we can improve on customer service and our approach	customer
in our need to follow processes, many times we miss the importance of being in line with the demands of the market and the needs of the consumer; extremely important factors to succeed/survive in this fast faced logistics environment.	customer
we need to continue working on initiatives to improve our processes, day to day service.	customer
as an organization all teams come together to offer the best possible service to our customers.	customer
customers should be cared for more proactively: the initiative for alternative solutions must come from ourselves, not just after being pushed by the customer.	customer
we have lots of customer complaint the service and finally stop the biz with us.	customer
we have to improve our service levels as per customer commitment.	customer
the sharing of ideas and co-operation between direct & indirect functions in order to improve services from internal service providers	customer
